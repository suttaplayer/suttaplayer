A MEAL
BHOJANA SUTTA  Aṅguttara Nikāya 5:37

'In giving a meal, the donor gives five things to the recipient. Which five? He or she gives life, beauty, happiness, strength, & quick-wittedness. Having given life, he or she has a share in long life, either human or divine. Having given beauty, he or she has a share in beauty, either human or divine. Having given happiness, he or she has a share in happiness, either human or divine. Having given strength, he or she has a share in strength, either human or divine. Having given quick-wittedness, he or she has a share in quick-wittedness, either human or divine. In giving a meal, the donor gives these five things to the recipient.'

The enlightened person giving life, strength,

beauty, quick-wittedness—

the intelligent person, a giver of happiness—

attains happiness himself.

Having given life, strength, beauty,

happiness, & quick-wittedness,

he has long life & status

wherever he arises.
