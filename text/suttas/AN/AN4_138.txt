NIKKAṬṬHA SUTTA  Aṅguttara Nikāya 4:138

'Monks, there are these four persons to be found existing in the world. Which four? The one withdrawn in body but not withdrawn in mind, the one not withdrawn in body but withdrawn in mind, the one not withdrawn in body & not withdrawn in mind, and the one withdrawn in body & withdrawn in mind.

'And how is a person withdrawn in body but not withdrawn in mind? There is the case where a certain person resorts to isolated wilderness & forest dwellings. There he thinks thoughts of sensuality, he thinks thoughts of ill will, he thinks thoughts of harmfulness. This is how a person is withdrawn in body but not withdrawn in mind.

'And how is a person not withdrawn in body but withdrawn in mind? There is the case where a certain person doesn't resort to isolated wilderness & forest dwellings. He thinks thoughts of renunciation, he thinks thoughts of non-ill will, he thinks thoughts of harmlessness. This is how a person is not withdrawn in body but withdrawn in mind.

'And how is a person not withdrawn in body & not withdrawn in mind? There is the case where a certain person doesn't resort to isolated wilderness & forest dwellings. He thinks thoughts of sensuality, he thinks thoughts of ill will, he thinks thoughts of harmfulness. This is how a person is not withdrawn in body & not withdrawn in mind.

'And how is a person withdrawn in body & withdrawn in mind? There is the case where a certain person resorts to isolated wilderness & forest dwellings.

'These, monks, are four persons to be found existing in the world.'
