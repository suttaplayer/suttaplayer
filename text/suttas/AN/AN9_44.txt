RELEASED THROUGH DISCERNMENT
PAÑÑĀVIMUTTI SUTTA  Aṅguttara Nikāya 9:44

[Venerable Udāyin:] 'Released through discernment, released through discernment,' it is said. To what extent is one described by the Blessed One as released through discernment?'

[Venerable Ānanda:] 'There is the case, my friend, where a monk, quite secluded from sensuality, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters & remains in the first jhāna: rapture & pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by directed thought & evaluation. And he knows it through discernment. It's to this extent that one is described by the Blessed One as released through discernment, though with a sequel.

'Then, with the stilling of directed thoughts & evaluations, he enters & remains in the second jhāna… the third jhāna… the fourth jhāna… the dimension of the infinitude of space… the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness… the dimension of nothingness… the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. And he knows it through discernment. It's to this extent that one is described by the Blessed One as released through discernment, though with a sequel.

'Then, with the complete transcending of the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, he enters & remains in the cessation of perception & feeling. And as he sees (that) with discernment, effluents are completely ended. And he knows it through discernment. It's to this extent that one is described by the Blessed One as released through discernment without a sequel.'
