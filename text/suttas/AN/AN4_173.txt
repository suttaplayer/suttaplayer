TO KOṬṬHITA
KOṬṬHITA SUTTA  Aṅguttara Nikāya 4:173

Then Venerable Mahā Koṭṭhita went to Venerable Sāriputta and, on arrival, exchanged courteous greetings with him. After an exchange of friendly greetings & courtesies, he sat to one side. As he was sitting there, he said to Venerable Sāriputta, 'With the remainderless fading & cessation of the six contact-media [vision, hearing, smell, taste, touch, & intellection], is it the case that there is anything else?'

[Venerable Sāriputta:] 'Don't say that, my friend.'

[Venerable Mahā Koṭṭhita:] 'With the remainderless fading & cessation of the six contact-media, is it the case that there is not anything else?'

[Venerable Sāriputta:] 'Don't say that, my friend.'

[Venerable Mahā Koṭṭhita:] '…is it the case that there both is & is not anything else?'

[Venerable Sāriputta:] 'Don't say that, my friend.'

[Venerable Mahā Koṭṭhita:] '…is it the case that there neither is nor is not anything else?'

[Venerable Sāriputta:] 'Don't say that, my friend.'

[Venerable Mahā Koṭṭhita:] 'Being asked if, with the remainderless fading & cessation of the six contact-media, there is anything else, you say, 'Don't say that, my friend.' Being asked if… there is not anything else… there both is & is not anything else… there neither is nor is not anything else, you say, 'Don't say that, my friend.' Now, how is the meaning of your words to be understood?'

[Venerable Sāriputta:] 'The statement, 'With the remainderless fading & cessation of the six contact-media, is it the case that there is anything else?' objectifies the unobjectified. The statement, '… is it the case that there is not anything else… is it the case that there both is & is not anything else… is it the case that there neither is nor is not anything else?' objectifies the unobjectified. However far the six contact-media go, that is how far objectification goes. However far objectification goes, that is how far the six contact-media go. With the remainderless fading & cessation of the six contact-media, there comes to be the cessation of objectification, the stilling of objectification.'
