A FRIEND
MITTA SUTTA  Aṅguttara Nikāya 7:35

'Monks, a friend endowed with seven qualities is worth associating with. Which seven? He gives what is hard to give. He does what is hard to do. He endures what is hard to endure. He reveals his secrets to you. He keeps your secrets. When misfortunes strike, he doesn't abandon you. When you're down & out, he doesn't look down on you. A friend endowed with these seven qualities is worth associating with.

'He gives what is beautiful,

hard to give;

does what is hard to do;

endures painful, ill-spoken words.

His secrets he tells you;

your secrets he keeps.

When misfortunes strike,

he doesn't abandon you;

when you're down & out,

doesn't look down on you.

A person in whom these traits are found,

is a friend to be cultivated

by anyone wanting a friend.'
