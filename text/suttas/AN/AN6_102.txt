WITHOUT EXCEPTION (1)
ANODHI SUTTA  Aṅguttara Nikāya 6:102

'In seeing six rewards, it's enough for a monk to establish the perception of inconstancy with regard to all fabrications without exception. Which six? 'All fabrications will appear as unstable. My mind will not delight in any world. My mind will rise above every world. My heart will be inclined to unbinding. My fetters will go to their abandoning. I'll be endowed with the foremost qualities of the contemplative life.'
