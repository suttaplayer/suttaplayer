[4] 'He is composed & easy to live with, and doesn't harass the other horses.

[8] 'He is steadfast and remains steadfast to the end of life & death.

'Endowed with these eight qualities, a king's auspicious thoroughbred steed is worthy of a king, is a king's asset, counts as a very limb of his king.

'In the same way, a monk endowed with eight qualities is deserving of gifts, deserving of hospitality, deserving of offerings, deserving of respect, an incomparable field of merit for the world. Which eight?

[6] 'When in training he gives rise to the thought, 'Whether the other monks want to train or not, I'll train here.'

[7] 'When going, he goes the straight path; here the straight path is this: right view, right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration.

[8] 'He dwells with his persistence aroused, (thinking,) 'Gladly would I let the flesh & blood in my body dry up, leaving just the skin, tendons, & bones, but if I have not attained what can be reached through human steadfastness, human persistence, human striving, there will be no relaxing my persistence.'

'Endowed with these eight qualities, a monk is deserving of gifts, deserving of hospitality, deserving of offerings, deserving of respect, an incomparable field of merit for the world.'
