PERVERSIONS
VIPALLĀSA SUTTA  Aṅguttara Nikāya 4:49

'Monks, there are these four perversions of perception, perversions of mind, perversions of view. Which four? 'Constant' with regard to the inconstant is a perversion of perception, a perversion of mind, a perversion of view. 'Pleasant' with regard to the stressful.… 'Self' with regard to not-self.… 'Attractive' with regard to the unattractive is a perversion of perception, a perversion of mind, a perversion of view. These are the four perversions of perception, perversions of mind, perversions of view.

'There are these four non-perversions of perception, non-perversions of mind, non-perversions of view. Which four? 'Inconstant' with regard to the inconstant is a non-perversion of perception, a non-perversion of mind, a non-perversion of view. 'Stressful' with regard to the stressful.… 'Not-self' with regard to not-self.… 'Unattractive' with regard to the unattractive is a non-perversion of perception, a non-perversion of mind, a non-perversion of view. These are the four non-perversions of perception, non-perversions of mind, non-perversions of view.'

Perceiving

constancy in the inconstant,

pleasure in the stressful,

self in what's not-self,

attractiveness in the unattractive,

beings, destroyed by wrong-view,

go mad, out of their minds.

Bound to Māra's yoke,

from the yoke they find no rest.

Beings go on to the wandering-on,

leading to birth & death.

But when Awakened Ones

arise in the world,

bringing light to the world,

they proclaim the Dhamma

leading to the stilling of stress.

When those with discernment listen,

they regain their senses,

seeing      the inconstant as inconstant,

the stressful as stressful,

what's not-self as not-self,

the unattractive as unattractive.

Undertaking right view,

they transcend all stress & suffering.
