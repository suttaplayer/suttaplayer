'These are three fabricated characteristics of what is fabricated.

'Now these three are unfabricated characteristics of what is unfabricated. Which three? No arising is discernable, no passing away is discernable, no alteration while staying is discernable.

'These are three unfabricated characteristics of what is unfabricated.'
