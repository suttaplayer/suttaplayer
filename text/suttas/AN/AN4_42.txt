QUESTIONS
PAÑHA SUTTA  Aṅguttara Nikāya 4:42

'There are these four ways of answering questions. Which four? There are questions that should be answered categorically [straightforwardly yes, no, this, that]. There are questions that should be answered with an analytical answer [defining or redefining the terms]. There are questions that should be answered with a counter-question. There are questions that should be put aside. These are the four ways of answering questions.'

First the categorical statement,

then the analytical statement,

third, the type to be counter-questioned,

& fourth, the one to be put aside.

Any monk who knows which is which,

in line with the Dhamma,

is said to be skilled

in the four types of questions:

hard to overcome, hard to beat,

profound, hard to defeat.

He knows what's worthwhile

& what's not,

proficient in (recognizing) both,

he

rejects the worthless,

grasps the worthwhile.

He's called

one who has broken through

to what's worthwhile,

enlightened,

wise.
