IMPURITIES
MALA SUTTA  Aṅguttara Nikāya 3:10

'Monks, when one is endowed with three qualities, without abandoning three impurities, then as if one had been carried off, one would thus be placed in hell. Which three? One is unvirtuous and hasn't abandoned the impurity of being unvirtuous. One is envious and hasn't abandoned the impurity of envy. One is stingy and hasn't abandoned the impurity of stinginess. When one is endowed with these three qualities, without abandoning these three impurities, then as if one had been carried off, one would thus be placed in hell.
