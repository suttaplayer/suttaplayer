INCAPABLE
ABHABBA SUTTA  Aṅguttara Nikāya 6:91

'Monks, a person consummate in view is incapable of giving rise to six things. Which six? Self-identity view, doubt, grasping at habits & practices, passion that would lead to a lower realm, anger that would lead to a lower realm, delusion that would lead to a lower realm.

'A person consummate in view is incapable of giving rise to these six things.'
