COMPLIANCE (1)
SOVACASSATĀ SUTTA  Aṅguttara Nikāya 7:33

'Last night, monks, a certain devatā in the far extreme of the night, her extreme radiance lighting up the entirety of Jeta's Grove, came to me and, on arrival, bowed down to me and stood to one side. As she was standing there, she said to me, 'These seven qualities, lord, lead to a monk's non-decline. Which seven? Respect for the teacher, respect for the Dhamma, respect for the Saṅgha, respect for training, respect for concentration, compliance, having admirable friends. These seven qualities, lord, lead to a monk's non-decline.'

'That is what that devatā said. Having said it, she bowed down to me, circled me three times, and then disappeared right there.'

Respecting the Teacher

respecting the Dhamma,

and with fierce respect for the Saṅgha,

respecting concentration, ardent,

and with fierce respect for training,

having admirable friends, compliant,

deferential, respectful

—incapable of decline—

one is right in the presence of unbinding.
