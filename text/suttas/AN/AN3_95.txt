AUTUMN
SARADA SUTTA  Aṅguttara Nikāya 3:95

'Monks, just as in autumn, when the sky is clear & cloudless, the sun, on ascending the sky, overpowers the space immersed in darkness, shines, blazes, & dazzles; in the same way, when the dustless, stainless Dhamma eye arises in a noble disciple, together with its arising three fetters are abandoned by the noble disciple: self-identification view, doubt, and grasping at habits & practices. Afterwards, when he leaves two qualities—greed & ill will—then, quite secluded from sensuality, secluded from unskillful qualities, he enters & remains in the first jhāna: rapture & pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by directed thought & evaluation. If the noble disciple passes away at that time, there is no fetter bound by which he would return to this world.'
