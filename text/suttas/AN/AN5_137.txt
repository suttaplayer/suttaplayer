ONE SLEEPS LITTLE
APPAṀ SUTTA  Aṅguttara Nikāya 5:137

'Monks, these five get little sleep at night, and are mostly awake. Which five? A woman intent on a man gets little sleep at night, and is mostly awake. A man intent on a woman gets little sleep at night, and is mostly awake. A thief intent on theft gets little sleep at night, and is mostly awake. A king fettered by royal duties gets little sleep at night, and is mostly awake. A monk intent on becoming unfettered gets little sleep at night, and is mostly awake.

'These five, monks, get little sleep at night, and are mostly awake.'
