HEEDFULNESS
APPAMĀDA SUTTA  Aṅguttara Nikāya 4:116

'Monks, there are four instances where heedfulness should be exercised. Which four? Abandon bodily misconduct, develop good bodily conduct: Don't be heedless there. Abandon verbal misconduct, develop good verbal conduct: Don't be heedless there. Abandon mental misconduct, develop good mental conduct: Don't be heedless there. Abandon wrong view, develop right view: Don't be heedless there.

'When, in a monk, bodily misconduct is abandoned, good bodily conduct is developed; verbal misconduct is abandoned, good verbal conduct is developed; mental misconduct is abandoned, good mental conduct is developed; wrong view is abandoned, right view is developed, then he has no fear of death as it relates to the next life.'
