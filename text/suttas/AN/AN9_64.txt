HINDRANCES
NĪVARAṆA SUTTA  Aṅguttara Nikāya 9:64

'Monks, there are these five hindrances. Which five? Sensual desire as a hindrance, ill will as a hindrance, sloth & drowsiness as a hindrance, restlessness & anxiety as a hindrance, and uncertainty as a hindrance. These are the five hindrances.

'To abandon these five hindrances, one should develop the four establishings of mindfulness. Which four? There is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in & of itself… feelings in & of themselves… mind in & of itself… mental qualities in & of themselves—ardent, alert, & mindful—subduing greed & distress with reference to the world. To abandon the five hindrances, one should develop these four establishings of mindfulness.'
