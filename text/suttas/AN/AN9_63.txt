THINGS THAT WEAKEN THE TRAINING
SIKKHĀ-DUBBALYA SUTTA  Aṅguttara Nikāya 9:63

'Monks, these five are things that weaken the training. Which five? The taking of life, stealing, sexual misconduct, the telling of lies, and distilled & fermented beverages that are a cause for heedlessness. These five are things that weaken the training.

'To abandon these five things that weaken the training, one should develop the four establishings of mindfulness. Which four? There is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in & of itself… feelings in & of themselves… mind in & of itself… mental qualities in & of themselves—ardent, alert, & mindful—subduing greed & distress with reference to the world. To abandon the five things that weaken the training, one should develop these four establishings of mindfulness.'
