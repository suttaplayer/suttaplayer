RARE
DULLABHA SUTTA  Aṅguttara Nikāya 3:115

'Monks, the appearance of three [persons] is rare in the world. Which three? The appearance of the Tathāgata, worthy & rightly self-awakened, is rare in the world. A person who teaches the Dhamma & Vinaya proclaimed by the Tathāgata is rare in the world. A person who is grateful & thankful is rare in the world.

'Monks, the appearance of these three is rare in the world.'
