LUMINOUS
PABHASSARA SUTTAS  Aṅguttara Nikāya 1:50 TO 53

'Luminous, monks, is the mind. And it is defiled by incoming defilements.'

'Luminous, monks, is the mind. And it is freed from incoming defilements.'

'Luminous, monks, is the mind. And it is defiled by incoming defilements. The uninstructed run-of-the-mill person doesn't discern that as it has come to be, which is why I tell you that—for the uninstructed run-of-the-mill person—there is no development of the mind.'

'Luminous, monks, is the mind. And it is freed from incoming defilements. The well-instructed disciple of the noble ones discerns that as it has come to be, which is why I tell you that—for the well-instructed disciple of the noble ones—there is development of the mind.'
