A SHARE IN CLEAR KNOWING
VIJJĀ-BHĀGIYA SUTTA  Aṅguttara Nikāya 2:29

'These two qualities have a share in clear knowing. Which two? Tranquility [samatha] & insight [vipassanā].

'When tranquility is developed, what purpose does it serve? The mind is developed. And when the mind is developed, what purpose does it serve? Passion is abandoned.

'When insight is developed, what purpose does it serve? Discernment is developed. And when discernment is developed, what purpose does it serve? Ignorance is abandoned.'
