'May what is subject to aging not age': For this there is no guarantor—neither a contemplative, nor a brahman, nor a deva, nor a Māra, nor a Brahmā, nor anyone at all in the world.

'May what is subject to illness not fall ill': For this there is no guarantor—neither a contemplative, nor a brahman, nor a deva, nor a Māra, nor a Brahmā, nor anyone at all in the world.

'May what is subject to death not die': For this there is no guarantor—neither a contemplative, nor a brahman, nor a deva, nor a Māra, nor a Brahmā, nor anyone at all in the world.

'May the results of evil actions—defiled, leading to further becoming, distressing, ripening in pain & future birth, aging, & death—not appear': For this there is no guarantor—neither a contemplative, nor a brahman, nor a deva, nor a Māra, nor a Brahmā, nor anyone at all in the world.

'For these four things, monks, there is no guarantor—neither a contemplative, nor a brahman, nor a deva, nor a Māra, nor a Brahmā, nor anyone at all in the world.'
