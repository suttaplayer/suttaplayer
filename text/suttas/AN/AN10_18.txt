PROTECTORS (2)
NĀTHA SUTTA  Aṅguttara Nikāya 10:18

'Live with a protector, monks, and not without a protector. He suffers, one who lives without a protector. And these ten are qualities creating a protector. Which ten?

Even monks of middle standing & newcoming monks think that he should be corrected & instructed. For him—treated with sympathy by the elders, sympathy by those of middle standing, & sympathy by newcomers—growth in skillful qualities is to be expected, and not decline. This is a quality creating a protector.

'Then again, the monk has heard much, has retained what he has heard, has stored what he has heard. Whatever teachings are admirable in the beginning, admirable in the middle, admirable in the end, that—in their meaning & expression—proclaim the holy life that is entirely perfect, surpassingly pure: Those he has listened to often, retained, discussed, accumulated, examined with his mind, & well-penetrated in terms of his views.
