ON ASKING QUESTIONS
PAÑHAPUCCHĀ SUTTA  Aṅguttara Nikāya 5:165

Then Venerable Sāriputta addressed the monks: 'Friend monks.'

'Yes, friend,' the monks responded to him.

Venerable Sāriputta said: 'All those who ask questions of another do so from any one of five motivations. Which five?

'One asks a question of another through stupidity & bewilderment. One asks a question of another through evil desires & overwhelmed with greed. One asks a question of another through contempt. One asks a question of another when desiring knowledge. Or one asks a question with this thought, 'If, when asked, he answers correctly, well & good. If not, then I will answer correctly (for him).'

'All those who ask questions of another do so from any one of these five motivations. And as for me, when I ask a question of another, it's with this thought: 'If, when asked, he answers correctly, well & good. If not, then I will answer correctly (for him).'
