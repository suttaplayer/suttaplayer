WHAT WAS NOT SAID
ABHĀSITA SUTTA  Aṅguttara Nikāya 2:23

'Monks, these two slander the Tathāgata. Which two? He who explains what was not said or spoken by the Tathāgata as said or spoken by the Tathāgata. And he who explains what was said or spoken by the Tathāgata as not said or spoken by the Tathāgata. These are the two who slander the Tathāgata.'
