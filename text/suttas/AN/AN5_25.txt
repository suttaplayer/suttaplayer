SUPPORTED
ANUGGHITA SUTTA  Aṅguttara Nikāya 5:25

'Monks, when right view is supported by five factors, it has awareness-release as its fruit, awareness-release as its reward; has discernment-release as its fruit, discernment-release as its reward. Which five?

'There is the case where right view is supported by virtue, supported by learning, supported by discussion, supported by tranquility, supported by insight.

'When supported by these five factors, right view has awareness-release as its fruit, awareness-release as its reward; has discernment-release as its fruit, discernment-release as its reward.'
