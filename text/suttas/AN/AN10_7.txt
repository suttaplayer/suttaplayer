WITH SĀRIPUTTA
SĀRIPUTTA SUTTA  Aṅguttara Nikāya 10:7

Then Venerable Ānanda went to Venerable Sāriputta and, on arrival, exchanged courteous greetings with him. After an exchange of friendly greetings & courtesies, he sat to one side. As he was sitting there, he said to Venerable Sāriputta, 'Friend Sāriputta, could a monk have an attainment of concentration such that he would neither be percipient of earth with regard to earth, nor of water with regard to water, nor of fire… wind… the dimension of the infinitude of space… the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness… the dimension of nothingness… the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception… this world… nor of the next world with regard to the next world, and yet he would still be percipient?'

'Yes, friend Ānanda, he could.…'

'But how, friend Sāriputta, could a monk have an attainment of concentration such that he would neither be percipient of earth with regard to earth…nor of the next world with regard to the next world, and yet he would still be percipient?'

'Once, friend Ānanda, when I was staying right here near Sāvatthī in the Grove of the Blind, I reached concentration in such a way that I was neither percipient of earth with regard to earth…nor of the next world with regard to the next world, and yet I was still percipient.'

'But what, friend Sāriputta, were you percipient of at that time?'

'The cessation of becoming—unbinding—the cessation of becoming—unbinding': One perception arose in me, friend Ānanda, as another perception ceased. Just as in a blazing woodchip fire, one flame arises as another flame ceases, even so, 'The cessation of becoming—unbinding—the cessation of becoming—unbinding': One perception arose in me as another one ceased. I was percipient at that time of 'The cessation of becoming—unbinding.'
