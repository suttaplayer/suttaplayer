INAPPROPRIATELY
AYONISO SUTTA  Aṅguttara Nikāya 3:5

'Monks, a person endowed with three qualities is to be recognized as a fool. Which three? He formulates a question inappropriately. He answers a question inappropriately. When another answers a question appropriately—having chosen circumscribed, coherent words & phrases—he doesn't approve of it. A person endowed with these three qualities is to be recognized as a fool.
