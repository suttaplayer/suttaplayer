CHARACTERIZED (BY ACTION)
LAKKHAṆA SUTTA  Aṅguttara Nikāya 3:2

'Monks, a fool is characterized by his or her actions. A wise person is characterized by his or her actions. It is through the activities of one's life that one's discernment shines.

'A person endowed with three things is to be recognized as a fool. Which three? Bodily misconduct, verbal misconduct, mental misconduct. A person endowed with these three things is to be recognized as a fool.

'A person endowed with three things is to be recognized as a wise person. Which three? Good bodily conduct, good verbal conduct, good mental conduct. A person endowed with these three things is to be recognized as a wise person.

'Thus, monks, you should train yourselves: 'We will avoid the three things that, endowed with which, one is to be recognized as a fool. We will undertake & maintain the three things that, endowed with which, one is to be recognized as a wise person.' That's how you should train yourselves.'
