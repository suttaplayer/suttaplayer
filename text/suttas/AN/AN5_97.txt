TALK
KATHĀ SUTTA  Aṅguttara Nikāya 5:97

'Endowed with five qualities, a monk pursuing mindfulness of breathing will in no long time penetrate the Unprovoked (release). Which five?

'He is a person who imposes only a little (on others): one of few duties & projects, easy to support, easily contented with the requisites of life.

'He is a person who eats only a little food, committed to not indulging his stomach.

'He is a person of only a little sloth, committed to wakefulness.

'He gets to hear at will, easily & without difficulty, talk that is truly sobering & conducive to the opening of awareness: talk on modesty, contentment, seclusion, non-entanglement, arousing persistence, virtue, concentration, discernment, release, and the knowledge & vision of release.

'He reflects on the mind as it is released.

'Endowed with these five qualities, a monk pursuing mindfulness of breathing will in no long time penetrate the Unprovoked.'
