WALKING
CAṄKAMA SUTTA  Aṅguttara Nikāya 5:29

'Monks, these are the five rewards for one who practices walking meditation. Which five?

'He can endure traveling by foot; he can endure exertion; he becomes free from disease; whatever he has eaten & drunk, chewed & savored, becomes well-digested; the concentration he wins while doing walking meditation lasts for a long time.
