TO UGGA
UGGA SUTTA  Aṅguttara Nikāya 7:7

Then Ugga, the king's chief minister, approached the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down, sat to one side. As he was sitting there, he said to the Blessed One: 'It's amazing, lord, & astounding, how prosperous Migāra Rohaṇeyya is, how great his treasures, how great his resources!'

[The Buddha:] 'But what is his property, Ugga? What are his great treasures & great resources?'

'One hundred thousand pieces of gold, lord, to say nothing of his silver.'

'That is treasure, Ugga. I don't say that it's not. And that treasure is open to fire, floods, kings, thieves, & hateful heirs. But these seven treasures are not open to fire, flood, kings, thieves, or hateful heirs. Which seven? The treasure of conviction, the treasure of virtue, the treasure of a sense of shame, the treasure of a sense of compunction, the treasure of listening, the treasure of generosity, the treasure of discernment. These, Ugga, are the seven treasures that are not open to fire, flood, kings, thieves, or hateful heirs.'

The treasure of conviction,

the treasure of virtue,

the treasure of a sense of shame & compunction,

the treasure of listening, generosity,

& discernment as the seventh treasure:

Whoever, man or woman, has these treasures,

has great treasure in the world

that no being,

human or divine,

can excel.

So conviction & virtue, faith & Dhamma-vision

should be cultivated by the intelligent,

remembering the Buddhas' instruction.
