FETTERS
SAÑÑOJANA SUTTA  Aṅguttara Nikāya 4:88

'Monks, these four persons are to be found existing in the world. Which four? The unshakeable contemplative, the white-lotus contemplative, the red-lotus contemplative, the most refined contemplative among contemplatives.

'And how is a person an unshakeable contemplative? There is the case where a monk, through the ending of (the first) three fetters, is a stream-enterer, certain, never again destined for the lower realms, headed for self-awakening. This is how a person is an unshakeable contemplative.

'And how is a person a white-lotus contemplative? There is the case where a monk, through the ending of (the first) three fetters, and with the attenuation of passion, aversion, & delusion, is a once-returner, who—on returning only once more to this world—will make an ending to stress. This is how a person is a white-lotus contemplative.

'And how is a person a red-lotus contemplative? There is the case where a monk, through the ending of the five lower fetters, is due to arise spontaneously (in the Pure Abodes), there to be totally unbound, destined never again to return from that world. This is how a person is a red-lotus contemplative.

'And how is a person the most refined contemplative among contemplatives? There is the case where a monk, through the ending of effluents, enters & remains in the effluent-free awareness-release & discernment-release, having directly known & realized it for himself right in the here & now. This is how a person is the most refined contemplative among contemplatives.

'These, monks, are four persons to be found existing in the world.'
