WITHOUT EXCEPTION (2)
ANODHI SUTTA  Aṅguttara Nikāya 6:103

'In seeing six rewards, it's enough for a monk to establish the perception of stress with regard to all fabrications without exception. Which six? 'The perception of disenchantment will be established within me with regard to all fabrications, like a murderer with a drawn sword. My mind will rise above every world. I'll become one who sees peace in unbinding. My obsessions will go to their destruction. I'll be one who has completed his task. The Teacher will have been served with goodwill.'
