A MEANING TO BE INFERRED
NEYYATTHA SUTTA  Aṅguttara Nikāya 2:24

'Monks, these two slander the Tathāgata. Which two? He who explains a discourse whose meaning needs to be inferred as one whose meaning has already been fully drawn out. And he who explains a discourse whose meaning has already been fully drawn out as one whose meaning needs to be inferred. These are the two who slander the Tathāgata.'
