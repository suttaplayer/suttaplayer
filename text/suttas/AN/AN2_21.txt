FOOLS & WISE PEOPLE
BĀLA-PAṆḌITA SUTTA  Aṅguttara Nikāya 2:21

'Monks, these two are fools. Which two? The one who doesn't see his transgression as a transgression, and the one who doesn't rightfully pardon another who has confessed his transgression. These two are fools.

'These two are wise people. Which two? The one who sees his transgression as a transgression, and the one who rightfully pardons another who has confessed his transgression. These two are wise people.'
