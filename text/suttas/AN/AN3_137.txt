THE ORDERLINESS OF THE DHAMMA
DHAMMA-NIYĀMA SUTTA  Aṅguttara Nikāya 3:137

I have heard that at one time the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery. There he addressed the monks, saying, 'Monks.'

'Yes, lord,' the monks responded to him.

The Blessed One said, 'Whether or not there is the arising of Tathāgatas, this property stands—this steadfastness of the Dhamma, this orderliness of the Dhamma: 'All fabrications are inconstant.'

'The Tathāgata directly awakens to that, breaks through to that. Directly awakening & breaking through to that, he declares it, teaches it, describes it, sets it forth. He reveals it, explains it, makes it plain: 'All fabrications are inconstant.'

'Whether or not there is the arising of Tathāgatas, this property stands—this steadfastness of the Dhamma, this orderliness of the Dhamma: 'All fabrications are stressful.'

'The Tathāgata directly awakens to that, breaks through to that. Directly awakening & breaking through to that, he declares it, teaches it, describes it, sets it forth. He reveals it, explains it, makes it plain: 'All fabrications are stressful.'

'Whether or not there is the arising of Tathāgatas, this property stands—this steadfastness of the Dhamma, this orderliness of the Dhamma: 'All phenomena are not-self.'

'The Tathāgata directly awakens to that, breaks through to that. Directly awakening & breaking through to that, he declares it, teaches it, describes it, sets it forth. He reveals it, explains it, makes it plain: 'All phenomena are not-self.'

That is what the Blessed One said. Gratified, the monks delighted at his words.
