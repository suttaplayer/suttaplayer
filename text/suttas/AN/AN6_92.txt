CASES
ṬHĀNA SUTTA  Aṅguttara Nikāya 6:92

'Monks, these six are impossible cases. Which six?

'It's impossible for a person consummate in view to live without respect or deference for the Teacher. It's impossible for a person consummate in view to live without respect or deference for the Dhamma. It's impossible for a person consummate in view to live without respect or deference for the Saṅgha. It's impossible for a person consummate in view to live without respect or deference for the Training [heightened virtue, heightened concentration, heightened discernment]. It's impossible for a person consummate in view to return to that which should not be gone to. It's impossible for a person consummate in view to produce an eighth state of becoming.

'These six are impossible cases.'
