PAHĀRĀDA
PAHĀRĀDA SUTTA  Aṅguttara Nikāya 8:19

On one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Verañja at the root of Naḷeru's neem tree. Then Pahārāda the asura-king went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, stood to one side. As he was standing there, the Blessed One said to him, 'Do the asuras, Pahārāda, take great joy in the great ocean?'

'The asuras take great joy in the great ocean, lord.'

'And how many, Pahārāda, are the amazing & astounding qualities of the great ocean because of which, as they see them again & again, the asuras take great joy in the ocean?'

'Lord, there are eight amazing & astounding qualities of the great ocean because of which, as they see them again & again, the asuras take great joy in the great ocean. Which eight?

'[1] Lord, the great ocean has a gradual shelf, a gradual slope, a gradual inclination, with a sudden drop-off only after a long stretch.

Any dead body in the great ocean gets quickly washed to the shore and thrown up on dry land.… This is the third amazing & astounding quality of the great ocean because of which, as they see it again & again, the asuras take great joy in the great ocean.

'[4] And furthermore, lord, whatever great rivers there are—such as the Ganges, the Yamunā, the Aciravatī, the Sarabhū, the Mahī—on reaching the great ocean, give up their former names and are classed simply as 'great ocean'.… This is the fourth amazing & astounding quality of the great ocean because of which, as they see it again & again, the asuras take great joy in the great ocean.

'[5] And furthermore, lord, though the rivers of the world pour into the great ocean, and rains fall from the sky, no swelling or diminishing in the great ocean for that reason can be discerned.… This is the fifth amazing & astounding quality of the great ocean because of which, as they see it again & again, the asuras take great joy in the great ocean.

'[6] And furthermore, lord, the great ocean has a single taste: that of salt.… This is the sixth amazing & astounding quality of the great ocean because of which, as they see it again & again, the asuras take great joy in the great ocean.

'[7] And furthermore, lord, the great ocean has these many treasures of various kinds: pearls, sapphires, lapis lazulis, shells, quartz, coral, silver, gold, rubies, & cat's eyes.… This is the seventh amazing & astounding quality of the great ocean because of which, as they see it again & again, the asuras take great joy in the great ocean.

'[8] And furthermore, lord, the great ocean is the abode of such mighty beings as these: whales, whale-eaters, & whale-eater-eaters; asuras, nāgas, & gandhabbas. There are in the great ocean beings one hundred leagues long, two hundred… three hundred… four hundred… five hundred leagues long.

'These, lord, are the eight amazing & astounding qualities of the great ocean because of which, as they see them again & again, the asuras take great joy in the great ocean.

'But, lord, do the monks take great joy in this Dhamma & Vinaya?'

'The monks take great joy in this Dhamma & Vinaya, Pahārada.'

'And how many, lord, are the amazing & astounding qualities of this Dhamma & Vinaya because of which, as they see them again & again, the monks take great joy in this Dhamma & Vinaya?'

'Pahārāda, there are eight amazing & astounding qualities of this Dhamma & Vinaya because of which, as they see them again & again, the monks take great joy in this Dhamma & Vinaya. Which eight?

'[1] Just as the great ocean has a gradual shelf, a gradual slope, a gradual inclination, with a sudden drop-off only after a long stretch; in the same way, Pahārāda, this Dhamma & Vinaya has a gradual training, a gradual performance, a gradual practice, with a penetration to gnosis only after a long stretch.

'[3] And furthermore, just as the great ocean does not tolerate a dead body—any dead body in the great ocean getting quickly washed to the shore and thrown up on dry land—in the same way, Pahārāda, if an individual is unprincipled, evil, unclean & suspect in his undertakings, hidden in his actions—not a contemplative though claiming to be one, not leading the holy life though claiming to do so, inwardly rotten, oozing with desire, filthy by nature—the community has no affiliation with him. Having quickly gathered together, they suspend him from the community. Even though he may be sitting in the midst of the community of monks, he is far from the community, and the community far from him.… This is the third amazing & astounding quality of this Dhamma & Vinaya because of which, as they see it again & again, the monks take great joy in this Dhamma & Vinaya.

'[4] And furthermore, just as whatever great rivers there are—such as the Ganges, the Yamunā, the Aciravatī, the Sarabhū, the Mahī—on reaching the great ocean, give up their former names and are classed simply as 'great ocean'; in the same way, Pahārāda, when members of the four castes—noble warriors, brahmans, merchants, & workers—go forth from home to the homeless life in this Dhamma & Vinaya declared by the Tathāgata, they give up their former names & clans and are classed simply as 'contemplatives, sons of the Sakyan'.… This is the fourth amazing & astounding quality of this Dhamma & Vinaya because of which, as they see it again & again, the monks take great joy in this Dhamma & Vinaya.

'[5] And furthermore, just as the rivers of the world pour into the great ocean, and rains fall from the sky, but no swelling or diminishing in the great ocean for that reason can be discerned; in the same way, Pahārāda, although many monks are totally unbound into the property of unbinding with no fuel remaining, no swelling or diminishing in the property of unbinding for that reason can be discerned.… This is the fifth amazing & astounding quality of this Dhamma & Vinaya because of which, as they see it again & again, the monks take great joy in this Dhamma & Vinaya.

'[7] And furthermore, just as the great ocean has these many treasures of various kinds—pearls, sapphires, lapis lazulis, shells, quartz, coral, silver, gold, rubies, & cat's eyes—in the same way, Pahārāda, this Dhamma & Vinaya has these many treasures of various kinds: the four establishings of mindfulness, the four right exertions, the four bases of power, the five faculties, the five strengths, the seven factors for awakening, the noble eightfold path .… This is the seventh amazing & astounding quality of this Dhamma & Vinaya because of which, as they see it again & again, the monks take great joy in this Dhamma & Vinaya.
