'There is the case where a monk doesn't discern as it has come to be that 'This quality has a share in decline.' He doesn't discern as it has come to be that 'This quality has a share in stability.' He doesn't discern as it has come to be that 'This quality has a share in distinction.' He doesn't discern as it has come to be that 'This quality has a share in penetration.' He is one who doesn't act attentively. He is one who doesn't act suitably.
