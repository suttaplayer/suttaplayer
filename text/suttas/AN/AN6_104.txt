WITHOUT EXCEPTION (3)
ANODHI SUTTA  Aṅguttara Nikāya 6:104

'In seeing six rewards, it's enough for a monk to establish the perception of not-self with regard to all phenomena without exception. Which six? 'I won't be fashioned in connection with any world. My I-making will be stopped. My my-making will be stopped. I'll be endowed with uncommon knowledge. I'll become one who rightly sees cause, along with causally-originated phenomena.'
