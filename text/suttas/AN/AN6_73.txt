JHĀNA (1)
JHĀNA SUTTA  Aṅguttara Nikāya 6:73

'Monks, without abandoning six things, one is incapable of entering & remaining in the first jhāna. Which six? Sensual desire, ill will, sloth & drowsiness, restlessness & anxiety, uncertainty, and one has not seen well, with right discernment—as they have come to be—the drawbacks of sensuality. Without abandoning these six things, one is incapable of entering & remaining in the first jhāna.'
