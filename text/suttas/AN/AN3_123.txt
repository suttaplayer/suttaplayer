SAGACITY
MONEYYA SUTTA  Aṅguttara Nikāya 3:123

'Monks, there are these three forms of sagacity. Which three? Bodily sagacity, verbal sagacity, & mental sagacity.

'And what is bodily sagacity? There is the case where a monk abstains from taking life, abstains from theft, abstains from uncelibacy. This is called bodily sagacity.

'And what is verbal sagacity? There is the case where a monk abstains from telling lies, abstains from divisive speech, abstains from harsh speech, abstains from idle chatter. This is called verbal sagacity.

'And what is mental sagacity? There is the case where a monk who—with the ending of effluents—enters & remains in the effluent-free awareness-release & discernment-release, having directly known & realized it for himself right in the here & now. This is called mental sagacity.

'These, monks, are the three forms of sagacity.'

A sage in body, a sage in speech,

a sage in mind, without effluent,

a sage consummate in sagacity

is said to have abandoned

everything

—the All.
