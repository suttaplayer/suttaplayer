WILDERNESS
ĀRAÑÑA SUTTA  Aṅguttara Nikāya 5:98

'Endowed with five qualities, a monk pursuing mindfulness of breathing will in no long time penetrate the Unprovoked (release). Which five?

'He is a person who imposes only a little (on others): one of few duties & projects, easy to support, easily contented with the requisites of life.

'He is a person who eats only a little food, committed to not indulging his stomach.

'He is a person of only a little sloth, committed to wakefulness.

'He lives in the wilderness, in an isolated dwelling place.

'He reflects on the mind as it is released.

'Endowed with these five qualities, a monk pursuing mindfulness of breathing will in no long time penetrate the Unprovoked.'
