PROGRESSING BY TENS (Ones to Fives)
DASUTTARA SUTTA  Dīgha Nikāya 34

I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Campā on the banks of the Gaggarā Lake with a large community of monks, approximately 500 monks in all. There, Venerable Sāriputta addressed the monks, 'Friend monks!'

'Yes, friend,' the monks responded to him.

Venerable Sāriputta said,

'I will teach the Dhamma

progressing by tens,

for attaining unbinding,

for putting an end to suffering & stress,

for releasing from all ties.
