THE DISCOURSE FOR RECITING TOGETHER
@SAṄGĪTI SUTTA@  @Dīgha Nikāya@ 33

I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was wandering among the @Mallans@ with a large @Saṅgha@ of monks—approximately 500 monks in all—and arrived at @Pāvā@, a city of the @Mallans@. There he stayed near @Pāvā@ in @Cunda@ the silversmith's mango grove. Now, at that time a new reception hall named @Ubbhataka@ had just been built by the @Pāvā Mallans@, and it had not yet been dwelled in by any contemplative, @brahman@, or anyone at all in human form.

The @Pāvā Mallans@ heard, 'The Blessed One, they say, wandering among the @Mallans@ with a large @Saṅgha@ of monks—approximately 500 monks in all—has arrived at @Pāvā@ and is staying near @Pāvā@ in @Cunda@ the silversmith's mango grove.'

So the @Pāvā Mallans@ went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As they were sitting there they said to him, 'Lord, a new reception hall named @Ubbhataka@ has just been built by the @Pāvā Mallans@, and it has not yet been dwelled in by any contemplative, @brahman@, or anyone at all in human form. May the Blessed One be the first to use it. When the Blessed One has used it first, the @Pāvā Mallans@ will use it afterwards. That will be for their long-term welfare & happiness.'

The Blessed One acquiesced with silence. Sensing his acquiescence, the @Pāvā Mallans@ got up from their seats, bowed down to him, circumambulated him, and then went to the new reception hall. On arrival, they spread it all over with felt rugs, arranged seats, set out a water vessel, and raised an oil lamp. Then they went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, stood to one side. As they were standing there they said to him, 'Lord, the reception hall has been covered all over with felt rugs, seats have been arranged, a water vessel has been set out, and an oil lamp raised. It is now time for the Blessed One to do as he sees fit.'

So the Blessed One—after adjusting his under robe and carrying his bowl & outer robe—went together with the @Saṅgha@ of monks to the reception hall. On arrival he washed his feet, entered the hall, and sat with his back to the central post, facing east. The @Saṅgha@ of monks washed their feet, entered the hall, and sat with their backs to the western wall, facing east, ranged around the Blessed One. The @Pāvā Mallans@ washed their feet, entered the hall, and sat with their backs to the eastern wall, facing west, ranged around the Blessed One. Then the Blessed One—having spent most of the night instructing, urging, rousing, & encouraging the @Pāvā Mallans@ with a @Dhamma@ talk—dismissed them, saying, 'The night is far gone, @Vaseṭṭhas@. Do what you think it is now time to do.'

Responding, 'As you say, lord,' to the Blessed One, the @Pāvā Mallans@ got up from their seats and, bowing down to him & circumambulating him, left.

Then, not long after the @Pāvā Mallans@ had left, the Blessed One—surveying the silent @Saṅgha@ of monks—addressed Venerable @Sāriputta@, '@Sāriputta@, the @Saṅgha@ of monks is free of drowsiness. Let yourself be inspired by a @Dhamma@ talk for them. My back aches. I will rest it.'

'As you say, lord,' Venerable @Sāriputta@ responded to the Blessed One.

Then the Blessed One, having had his outer robe arranged folded in four, lay down on his right side in the lion's sleeping posture, with one foot on top of the other, mindful & alert, having made a mental note to get up.

Now, on that occasion @Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta@ had recently died in @Pāvā@. On his death, the @Nigaṇṭhas@ had split into two factions. They kept arguing, quarreling, & disputing, stabbing one another with weapons of the mouth: 'You don't understand this @Dhamma@-@Vinaya@. I understand this @Dhamma@-@Vinaya@. How could you understand this @Dhamma@-@Vinaya@? You practice wrongly. I practice rightly. I'm consistent. You're inconsistent. What should be said first, you said last. What should be said last, you said first. What you cogitated so long has been turned inside out. Your position has been overthrown. You're trapped, so go try to release your position or disentangle yourself if you can!' Nothing but slaughter, as it were, was being committed among the @Nigaṇṭha Nāṭa@-sons. Even the lay disciples of @Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta@, dressed in white, seemed disenchanted, disgusted, & repelled by the @Nigaṇṭha Nāṭa@-sons, and at how that poorly proclaimed @Dhamma@-@Vinaya@ was poorly expounded, not leading out, not conducive to calming, expounded by one who was not rightly self-awakened, its foundation [now] broken, without an arbiter.

So Venerable @Sāriputta@ addressed the monks, 'Friends, @Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta@ has recently died in @Pāvā@. On his death, the @Nigaṇṭhas@ have split into two factions.… Even the lay disciples of @Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta@, dressed in white, seem disenchanted, disgusted, & repelled by the @Nigaṇṭha Nāṭa@-sons, and at how that poorly proclaimed @Dhamma@-@Vinaya@ was poorly expounded, not leading out, not conducive to calming, expounded by one who was not rightly self-awakened, its foundation [now] broken, without an arbiter.

'That's the way it is, friends, with a poorly proclaimed @Dhamma@-@Vinaya@, poorly expounded, not leading out, not conducive to calming, expounded by one who is not rightly self-awakened. But our @Dhamma@ of the Blessed One is well expounded, leading out, conducive to calming, expounded by one who is rightly self-awakened. So it should all be recited together, without dispute, so that this holy life will endure & last a long time. That will be for the benefit & happiness of many, out of sympathy for the world, for the welfare, benefit, & happiness of @devas@ & human beings.

'And which is our @Dhamma@ of the Blessed One that is well expounded, leading out, conducive to calming, expounded by one who is rightly self-awakened, that should all be recited together, without dispute, so that this holy life will endure & last a long time, and that will be for the benefit & happiness of many, out of sympathy for the world, for the welfare, benefit, & happiness of @devas@ & human beings?

FOURS

'There are, friends, four @dhammas@ that are rightly expounded by the Blessed One—the one who knows, the one who sees, the Worthy One, rightly self-awakened. Those should all be recited together, without dispute, so that this holy life will endure & last a long time, and that will be for the benefit & happiness of many, out of sympathy for the world, for the welfare, benefit, & happiness of @devas@ & human beings.

• 'Four @jhānas@: There is the case, friends, where a monk—quite secluded from sensuality, secluded from unskillful qualities—enters & remains in the first @jhāna@: rapture & pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by directed thought & evaluation. With the stilling of directed thoughts & evaluations, he enters & remains in the second @jhāna@: rapture & pleasure born of concentration, unification of awareness free from directed thought & evaluation—internal assurance. With the fading of rapture, he remains equanimous, mindful, & alert, and senses pleasure with the body. He enters & remains in the third @jhāna@, of which the noble ones declare, 'Equanimous & mindful, one has a pleasant abiding.' With the abandoning of pleasure & pain—as with the earlier disappearance of elation & distress—he enters & remains in the fourth @jhāna@: purity of equanimity & mindfulness, neither pleasure nor pain.

'And which is the development of concentration that, when developed & pursued, leads to a pleasant abiding in the here & now?

This is the development of concentration that, when developed & pursued, leads to a pleasant abiding in the here & now.

'And which is the development of concentration that, when developed & pursued, leads to the attainment of knowledge & vision? There is the case where a monk attends to the perception of light and is resolved on the perception of daytime (at any hour of the day). Day (for him) is the same as night, night is the same as day. By means of an awareness open & unhampered, he develops a brightened mind. This is the development of concentration that, when developed & pursued, leads to the attainment of knowledge & vision.

'And which is the development of concentration that, when developed & pursued, leads to mindfulness & alertness? There is the case where feelings are known to the monk as they arise, known as they persist, known as they subside. Perceptions are known to him as they arise, known as they persist, known as they subside. Thoughts are known to him as they arise, known as they persist, known as they subside. This is the development of concentration that, when developed & pursued, leads to mindfulness & alertness.

'And which is the development of concentration that, when developed & pursued, leads to the ending of the effluents? There is the case where a monk remains focused on arising & falling away with reference to the five clinging-aggregates: 'Such is form, such its origination, such its passing away. Such is feeling, such its origination, such its passing away. Such is perception, such its origination, such its passing away. Such are fabrications, such their origination, such their passing away. Such is consciousness, such its origination, such its passing away.' This is the development of concentration that, when developed & pursued, leads to the ending of the effluents.

• 'Four immeasurables: There is the case, friends, where a monk keeps pervading the first direction [the east] with an awareness imbued with goodwill, likewise the second, likewise the third, likewise the fourth.

He keeps pervading the first direction with an awareness imbued with compassion… empathetic joy… equanimity, likewise the second, likewise the third, likewise the fourth. Thus above, below, & all around, everywhere, in its entirety, he keeps pervading the all-encompassing cosmos with an awareness imbued with equanimity—abundant, enlarged, immeasurable, without hostility, without ill will.

• 'Four formlessnesses: There is the case, friends, where a monk—with the complete transcending of perceptions of (physical) form, with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance, and not attending to perceptions of multiplicity, (perceiving,) 'Infinite space'—enters & remains in the dimension of the infinitude of space. With the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of space, (perceiving,) 'Infinite consciousness,' he enters & remains in the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness. With the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness, (perceiving,) 'There is nothing,' he enters & remains in the dimension of nothingness. With the complete transcending of the dimension of nothingness, he enters & remains in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.

He doesn't, for the sake of robe cloth, do anything unseemly or inappropriate. Not getting cloth, he isn't agitated. Getting cloth, he uses it unattached to it, uninfatuated, guiltless, seeing the drawbacks (of attachment to it), and discerning the escape from them. He doesn't, on account of his contentment with any old robe cloth at all, exalt himself or disparage others. Any monk who is diligent, deft, alert, & mindful in this is said to be a monk standing firm in the ancient, original traditions of the noble ones.

'And further, the monk is content with any old almsfood at all. He speaks in praise of being content with any old almsfood at all. He doesn't, for the sake of almsfood, do anything unseemly or inappropriate. Not getting almsfood, he isn't agitated. Getting almsfood, he uses it unattached to it, uninfatuated, guiltless, seeing the drawbacks (of attachment to it), and discerning the escape from them.

Any monk who is diligent, deft, alert, & mindful in this is said to be a monk standing firm in the ancient, original traditions of the noble ones.

'And further, the monk finds pleasure & delight in developing (skillful qualities), finds pleasure & delight in abandoning (unskillful qualities). He doesn't, on account of his pleasure & delight in developing & abandoning, exalt himself or disparage others. Any monk who is diligent, deft, alert, & mindful in this is said to be a monk standing firm in the ancient, original traditions of the noble ones.

• 'Four exertions: the exertion to guard, the exertion to abandon, the exertion to develop, & the exertion to maintain.

'And which, friends, is the exertion to guard? There is the case where a monk, on seeing a form via the eye, doesn't grasp at any theme or variations by which—if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the eye—evil, unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail him. He practices with restraint. He guards the faculty of the eye. He achieves restraint with regard to the faculty of the eye. [Similarly with the ear, nose, tongue, body, & intellect.] This is called the exertion to guard.

'And which is the exertion to abandon? There is the case where a monk doesn't acquiesce to a thought of sensuality that has arisen (in him). He abandons it, destroys it, dispels it, wipes it out of existence. He doesn't acquiesce to a thought of ill will… a thought of harmfulness… any evil, unskillful qualities that have arisen (in him). He abandons them, destroys them, dispels them, wipes them out of existence. This is called the exertion to abandon.

'And which is the exertion to develop? There is the case where a monk develops mindfulness as a factor for awakening dependent on seclusion, dependent on dispassion, dependent on cessation, resulting in letting go. He develops investigation of qualities… persistence… rapture… calm… concentration… equanimity as a factor for awakening dependent on seclusion, dependent on dispassion, dependent on cessation, resulting in letting go. This is called the exertion to develop.

'And which is the exertion to maintain? There is the case where a monk maintains a favorable theme of concentration—the skeleton perception, the worm-eaten perception, the livid perception, the festering perception, the falling-apart perception, the bloated perception. This is called the exertion to maintain.
