Dhammapada 25 : MONKS

Restraint with the eye is good,

good is restraint with the ear.

Restraint with the nose is good,

good is restraint with the tongue.

Restraint with the body is good,

good is restraint with speech.

Restraint with the heart is good,

good is restraint everywhere.

A monk everywhere restrained

is released from all suffering & stress.

Hands restrained,

feet restrained

speech restrained,

supremely restrained–

delighting in what is inward,

content, centered, alone:

he's what they call

a monk.

A monk restrained in his speaking,

giving counsel unruffled,

declaring the message & meaning:

sweet is his speech.

Dhamma his dwelling,

Dhamma his delight,

a monk pondering Dhamma,

calling Dhamma to mind,

does not fall away

from true Dhamma.

Gains:

don't treat your own with scorn,

don't go coveting those of others.

A monk who covets those of others

attains

no concentration.

Even if he gets next to nothing,

he doesn't treat his gains with scorn.

Living purely, untiring:

he's the one

that the devas praise.

For whom, in name & form

in every way,

there's no sense of mine,

& who doesn't grieve

for what's not:

he's deservedly called

a monk.

Dwelling in goodwill, a monk

with faith in the Awakened One's teaching,

would attain the good state,

the peaceful state:

stilling-of-fabrications ease.

Monk, bail out this boat.

It will take you lightly when bailed.

Having cut through passion, aversion,

you go from there to Unbinding.

Cut through five,

let go of five,

& develop five above all.

A monk gone past five attachments

is said to have crossed the flood.

Practice jhāna, monk,

and don't be heedless.

Don't take your mind roaming

in sensual strands.

Don't swallow–heedless–

the ball of iron aflame.

Don't burn & complain: 'This is pain.'

There's

no jhāna

for one with

no discernment,

no discernment

for one with

no jhāna.

But one with

both jhāna

& discernment:

he's on the verge

of Unbinding.

A monk with his mind at peace,

going into an empty dwelling,

clearly seeing the Dhamma aright:

his delight is more

than human.

However it is,

however it is he touches

the arising-&-passing of aggregates:

he gains rapture & joy:

that, for those who know it,

is deathless,

the Deathless.

Here the first things

for a discerning monk

are

guarding the senses,

contentment,

restraint in line with the Pāṭimokkha.

He should associate with admirable friends.

Living purely, untiring,

hospitable by habit,

skilled in his conduct,

gaining a manifold joy,

he will put an end

to suffering & stress.

Shed passion

& aversion, monks–

as a jasmine would,

its withered flowers.

Calmed in body,

calmed in speech,

well-centered & calm,

having disgorged the baits of the world,

a monk is called

thoroughly

calmed.

You yourself

should reprove yourself,

should examine yourself.

As a self-guarded monk

with guarded self,

mindful, you dwell at ease.

Your own self is

your own mainstay.

Your own self is

your own guide.

Therefore you should

watch over yourself–

as a trader, a fine steed.

A monk with a manifold joy,

with faith in the Awakened One's teaching,

would attain the good state,

the peaceful state:

stilling-of-fabrications ease.

A young monk who strives

in the Awakened One's teaching,

brightens the world

like the moon set free from a cloud.
