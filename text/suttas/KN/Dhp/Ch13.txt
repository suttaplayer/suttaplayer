Dhammapada 13 : WORLDS

Don't associate with lowly qualities.

Don't consort with heedlessness.

Don't associate with wrong views.

Don't busy yourself with the world.

Get up! Don't be heedless.

Live the Dhamma well.

One who lives the Dhamma

sleeps with ease

in this world & the next.

Live the Dhamma well.

Don't live it badly.

One who lives the Dhamma

sleeps with ease

in this world & the next.

See it as a bubble,

see it as a mirage:

one who regards the world this way

the King of Death doesn't see.

Come look at this world

all decked out

like a royal chariot,

where fools plunge in,

while those who know

don't cling.

Who once was heedless,

but later is not,

brightens the world

like the moon set free from a cloud.

His evil-done deed

is replaced with skillfulness:

he brightens the world

like the moon set free from a cloud.

Blinded this world–

how few here see clearly!

Just as birds who've escaped

from a net are

few, few

are the people

who make it to heaven.

Swans fly the path of the sun;

those with the power fly through space;

the enlightened flee from the world,

having defeated the armies of Māra.

The person who tells a lie,

who transgresses in this one thing,

transcending concern for the world beyond:

there's no evil

he might not do.

No misers go

to the world of the devas.

Those who don't praise giving

are fools.

The enlightened

express their approval for giving

and so find ease

in the world beyond.

Sole dominion over the earth,

going to heaven,

lordship over all worlds:

the fruit of stream entry

excels them.
