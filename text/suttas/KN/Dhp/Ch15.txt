Dhammapada 15 : HAPPY

How very happily we live,

free from hostility

among those who are hostile.

Among hostile people,

free from hostility we dwell.

How very happily we live,

free from misery

among those who are miserable.

Among miserable people,

free from misery we dwell.

How very happily we live,

free from busyness

among those who are busy.

Among busy people,

free from busyness we dwell.

How very happily we live,

we who have nothing.

We will feed on rapture

like the Radiant gods.

Winning gives birth to hostility.

Losing, one lies down in pain.

The calmed lie down with ease,

having set

winning & losing

aside.

There's no fire like passion,

no loss like anger,

no pain like the aggregates,

no ease other than peace.

Hunger: the foremost illness.

Fabrications: the foremost pain.

For one knowing this truth

as it has come to be,

Unbinding

is the foremost ease.

Freedom from illness: the foremost good fortune.

Contentment: the foremost wealth.

Trust: the foremost kinship.

Unbinding: the foremost ease.

Drinking the nourishment,

the flavor,

of seclusion & calm,

one is freed from evil, devoid

of distress,

refreshed with the nourishment

of rapture in the Dhamma.

It's good to see Noble Ones.

Happy their company–always.

Through not seeing fools

constantly, constantly

one would be happy.

For, living with a fool,

one grieves a long time.

Painful is communion with fools,

as with an enemy–

always.

Happy is communion

with the enlightened,

as with a gathering of kin.

So:

the enlightened man–

discerning, learned,

enduring, dutiful, noble,

intelligent, a man of integrity:

follow him

–one of this sort–

as the moon, the path

of the zodiac stars.
