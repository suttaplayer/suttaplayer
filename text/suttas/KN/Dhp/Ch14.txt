Dhammapada 14 : AWAKENED

Whose conquest can't be undone,

whose conquest no one in the world

can reach;

awakened, his pasture endless,

pathless:

by what path will you lead him astray?

In whom there's no craving

–the sticky ensnarer–

to lead him anywherever at all;

awakened, his pasture endless,

pathless:

by what path will you lead him astray?

They, the enlightened, intent on jhāna,

delighting in stilling

& renunciation,

self-awakened & mindful:

even the devas

view them with envy.

Hard   the winning of a human birth.

Hard   the life of mortals.

Hard   the chance to hear the true Dhamma.

Hard   the arising of Awakened Ones.

The non-doing

of any evil,

the performance

of what's skillful,

the cleansing

of one's own mind:

this is the teaching

of the Awakened.

Patient endurance:

the foremost austerity.

Unbinding:

the foremost,

so say the Awakened.

He who injures another

is no contemplative.

He who mistreats another,

no monk.

Not disparaging, not injuring,

restraint

in line with the Pāṭimokkha,

moderation

in food,

dwelling in                  seclusion,

commitment to the heightened mind:

this is the teaching

of the Awakened.

Not even if it rained gold coins

would we have our fill

of sensual pleasures.

'Stressful,

they give little enjoyment'–

knowing this, the wise one

finds no delight

even in heavenly sensual pleasures.

He is

one who delights

in the ending of craving,

a disciple of the Rightly

Self-Awakened One.

They go to many a refuge,

to mountains & forests,

to park & tree shrines:

people threatened with danger.

That's not the secure refuge,

not the supreme refuge,

that's not the refuge,

having gone to which,

you gain release

from all suffering & stress.

But when, having gone

to the Buddha, Dhamma,

& Saṅgha for refuge,

you see with right discernment

the four noble truths–

stress,

the cause of stress,

the transcending of stress,

& the noble eightfold path,

the way to the stilling of stress:

that's the secure refuge,

that, the supreme refuge,

that is the refuge,

having gone to which,

you gain release

from all suffering & stress.

It's hard to come by

a thoroughbred of a man.

It's simply not true

that he's born everywhere.

Wherever he's born, an enlightened one,

the family prospers,

is happy.

A blessing:      the arising of Awakened Ones.

A blessing:      the teaching of true Dhamma.

A blessing:      the concord of the Saṅgha.

The austerity of those in concord

is a blessing.

If you worship those worthy of worship,

–Awakened Ones or their disciples–

who've transcended

objectification,

crossed over

lamentation

& grief,

who are unendangered,

fearless,

unbound:

there's no measure for reckoning

that your merit's 'this much.'
