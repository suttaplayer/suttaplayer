Dhammapada 7 : ARAHANTS

In one who

has gone the full distance,

is free from sorrow,

is everywhere

fully released,

has abandoned all bonds:

no fever is found.

The mindful keep active,

don't delight in settling back.

They renounce every home,

every home,

like swans taking off from a lake.

Not hoarding,

having comprehended food,

their pasture–emptiness

& freedom without sign:

their course,

like that of birds through space,

can't be traced.

Effluents ended,

independent of nutriment,

their pasture–emptiness

& freedom without sign:

their trail,

like that of birds through space,

can't be traced.

He whose senses are steadied

like stallions

well-trained by the charioteer,

his conceit abandoned,

free of effluent,

Such:

even devas adore him.

Like the earth, he doesn't react–

cultured,

Such,

like Indra's pillar,

like a lake free of mud.

For him

–Such–

there's no traveling on.

Calm is his mind,

calm his speech

& his deed:

one who's released through right knowing,

pacified,

Such.

The man

faithless  or  beyond conviction

ungrateful  or  knowing the Unmade

a burglar  or  who has severed connections

who's destroyed

his chances  or  conditions

who eats vomit:  or  has disgorged expectations:

the ultimate person.

In village or wilds,

valley, plateau:

that place is delightful

where arahants dwell.

Delightful wilds

where the crowds don't delight,

those free from passion

delight,

for they're not searching

for sensual pleasures.
