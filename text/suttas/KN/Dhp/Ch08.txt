Dhammapada 8 : THOUSANDS

Better

than if there were thousands

of meaningless words is

one

meaningful

word

that on hearing

brings peace.

Better

than if there were thousands

of meaningless verses is

one

meaningful

line of verse

that on hearing

brings peace.

And better than chanting hundreds

of meaningless verses is

one

Dhamma-saying

that on hearing

brings peace.

Greater in battle

than the man who would conquer

a thousand-thousand men,

is he who would conquer

just one–

himself.

Better to conquer yourself

than others.

When you've trained yourself,

living in constant self-control,

neither a deva nor gandhabba,

nor a Māra banded with Brahmas,

could turn that triumph

back into defeat.

You could, month by month,

at a cost of thousands,

conduct sacrifices

a hundred times,

or

pay a single moment's homage

to one person,

self-cultivated.

Better than a hundred years of sacrifices

would that act of homage be.

You could, for a hundred years,

live in a forest

tending a fire,

or

pay a single moment's homage

to one person,

self-cultivated.

Better than a hundred years of sacrifices

would that act of homage be.

Everything offered

or sacrificed in the world

for an entire year by one seeking merit

doesn't come to a fourth.

Better to pay respect

to those who've gone

the straight way.

If you're respectful by habit,

constantly honoring the worthy,

four things increase:

long life, beauty,

happiness, strength.

Better than a hundred years

lived without virtue, uncentered, is

one day

lived by a virtuous person

absorbed in jhāna.

And better than a hundred years

lived undiscerning, uncentered, is

one day

lived by a discerning person

absorbed in jhāna.

And better than a hundred years

lived apathetic & unenergetic, is

one day

lived energetic & firm.

And better than a hundred years

lived without seeing

arising & passing away, is

one day

lived seeing

arising & passing away.

And better than a hundred years

lived without seeing

the Deathless state, is

one day

lived seeing

the Deathless state.

And better than a hundred years

lived without seeing

the ultimate Dhamma, is

one day

lived seeing

the ultimate Dhamma.
