Dhammapada 2 : HEEDFULNESS

Heedfulness:

the path to the Deathless.

Heedlessness:

the path to death.

The heedful do not die.

The heedless are as if

already dead.

Knowing this as a true distinction,

those wise

in heedfulness

rejoice

in heedfulness,

enjoying the range of the noble ones.

The enlightened, constantly

absorbed in jhāna,

persevering,

firm in their effort:

they touch Unbinding,

the unexcelled rest

from the yoke.

Those with initiative,

mindful,

clean in action,

acting with due consideration,

heedful, restrained,

living the Dhamma:

their glory

grows.

Through initiative, heedfulness,

restraint, & self-control,

the wise would make

an island

no flood

can submerge.

They're addicted to heedlessness

–dullards, fools–

while one who is wise

cherishes heedfulness

as his highest wealth.

Don't give way to heedlessness

or to intimacy

with sensual delight–

for a heedful person,

absorbed in jhāna,

attains an abundance of ease.

When the wise person drives out

heedlessness

with heedfulness,

having climbed the high tower

of discernment,

sorrow-free,

he observes the sorrowing crowd–

as the enlightened man,

having scaled

a summit,

the fools on the ground below.

Heedful among the heedless,

wakeful among those asleep,

just as a fast horse advances,

leaving the weak behind:

so the wise.

Through heedfulness, Indra won

to lordship over the devas.

Heedfulness is praised,

heedlessness censured–

always.

The monk delighting in heedfulness,

seeing danger in heedlessness,

advances like a fire,

burning fetters

great & small.

The monk delighting in heedfulness,

seeing danger in heedlessness

–incapable of falling back–

stands right on the verge

of Unbinding.
