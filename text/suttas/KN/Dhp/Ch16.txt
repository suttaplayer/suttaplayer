Dhammapada 16 : DEAR ONES

Having applied himself

to what was not his own task,

and not having applied himself

to what was,

having disregarded the goal

to grasp at what he held dear,

he now envies those

who

kept after themselves,

took themselves

to task.

Don't ever–regardless–

be conjoined with what's dear

or undear.

It's painful

not to see what's dear

or to see what's not.

So don't make anything dear,

for it's dreadful to be far

from what's dear.

No bonds are found

for those for whom

there's neither dear

nor undear.

From what's dear is born grief,

from what's dear is born fear.

For one freed from what's dear

there's no grief

–so how fear?

From what's loved is born grief,

from what's loved is born fear.

For one freed from what's loved

there's no grief

–so how fear?

From delight is born grief,

from delight is born fear.

For one freed from delight

there's no grief

–so how fear?

From sensuality is born grief,

from sensuality is born fear.

For one freed from sensuality

there's no grief

–so how fear?

From craving is born grief,

from craving is born fear.

For one freed from craving

there's no grief

–so how fear?

One consummate in virtue & vision,

judicious,

speaking the truth,

doing his own task:

the world holds him dear.

If

you've given birth to a wish

for what can't be expressed,

are suffused with heart,

your mind not enmeshed

in sensual passions:

you're said to be

in the up-flowing stream.

A man long absent

comes home safe from afar.

His kin, his friends, his companions,

delight in his return.

In just the same way,

when you've done good

& gone from this world

to the world beyond,

your good deeds receive you–

as kin, someone dear

come home.
