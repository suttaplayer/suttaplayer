Udāna 7:7 THE ENDING OF OBJECTIFICATION (PAPAÑCAKHAYA SUTTA)

I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery. And on that occasion the Blessed One was sitting, contemplating his own abandoning of the perceptions & categories of objectification.

Then the Blessed One, realizing his own abandoning of the perceptions & categories of objectification, on that occasion exclaimed:

One who

has no objectifications,

no standing-place,

who has gone beyond

the tether & cross-bar:

The world, even with its devas,

doesn't look down on him–

he, going about without craving,

a sage.
