Udāna 2:9 VISĀKHĀ (VISĀKHĀ SUTTA)

I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at the Eastern Monastery, the palace of Migāra's mother. And on that occasion, Visākhā, Migāra's mother, had some dealings with King Pasenadi Kosala that he did not settle as she had wished. So in the middle of the day she went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As she was sitting there the Blessed One said to her, 'Well now, Visākhā, where are you coming from in the middle of the day?'

'Just now, lord, I had some dealings with King Pasenadi Kosala that he did not settle as I had wished.'

Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:

All subjection to others

is painful.

All independence

is bliss.

What is held in common

brings suffering,

for duties are hard

to overcome.
