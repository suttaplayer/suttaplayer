Udāna 8:2 UNBINDING (2) (NIBBĀNA SUTTA)

I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery. And on that occasion the Blessed One was instructing, urging, rousing, & encouraging the monks with Dhamma-talk concerned with unbinding. The monks–receptive, attentive, focusing their entire awareness, lending ear–listened to the Dhamma.

Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:

It's hard to see the unaffected,

for the truth is not easily seen.

Craving is pierced

in one who knows;

For one who sees,

there is nothing.
