Udāna 2:7 THE ONLY SON (EKAPUTTA SUTTA)

I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery. And on that occasion the dear and beloved only son of a certain lay follower had died. So a large number of lay followers–their clothes wet, their hair wet–went to the Blessed One in the middle of the day and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As they were sitting there the Blessed One said to them: 'Why have you come here–your clothes wet, your hair wet–in the middle of the day?'

When this was said, the lay follower said to the Blessed One, 'My dear and beloved only son, lord, has died. This is why we have come here–our clothes wet, our hair wet–in the middle of the day.'

Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:

Tied down by the allure

of what seems dear,

hosts of devas, most human beings,

worn out with misery,

fall under the sway

of the King of Death.

But those who, day & night,

heedfully abandon

what seems dear,

dig up misery

by the root–

Death's bait

so hard

to overcome.
