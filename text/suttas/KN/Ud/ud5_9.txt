Udāna 5:9 JEERING (SADHĀYAMĀNA SUTTA)

I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was wandering among the Kosalans with a large community of monks. And on that occasion, a large number of youths passed by as if jeering not far from the Blessed One. The Blessed One saw the large number of youths passing by as if jeering not far away.

Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:

False pundits, totally muddled,

speaking in the range of mere words,

babbling as much as they like:

led on by what,

they don't know.
