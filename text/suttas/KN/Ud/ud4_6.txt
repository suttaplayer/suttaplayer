Udāna 4:6 PIṆḌOLA (PIṆḌOLA SUTTA)

I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery. And on that occasion Venerable Piṇḍola Bhāradvāja was sitting not far from the Blessed One, his legs crossed, his body held erect–a wilderness dweller, an alms-goer, a rag-robe wearer, an owner of only one set of three robes, modest, content, solitary, unentangled, his persistence aroused, an advocate of the ascetic practices, devoted to the heightened mind. The Blessed One saw Venerable Piṇḍola Bhāradvāja sitting not far away, his legs crossed, his body held erect–a wilderness dweller, an alms-goer, a rag-robe wearer, an owner of only one set of three robes, modest, content, solitary, unentangled, his persistence aroused, an advocate of the ascetic practices, devoted to the heightened mind.

Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:

Not disparaging, not injuring,

restraint      in line with the Pāṭimokkha,

moderation      in food,

dwelling      in seclusion,

commitment to the heightened mind:

this is the teaching

of the Awakened.
