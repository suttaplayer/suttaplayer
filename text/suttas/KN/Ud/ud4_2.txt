Ud훮na 4:2 HIGH-STRUNG (UDDHATA SUTTA)

I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in Upavattana, the Mallan sal grove near Kusin훮r훮. And on that occasion, not far from the Blessed One, many monks were staying in wilderness huts: high-strung, rowdy, unruly, talkative, of loose words & muddled mindfulness, unalert, unconcentrated, their minds scattered, their faculties left wide open.

The Blessed One saw those many monks staying in wilderness huts: high-strung, rowdy, unruly, talkative, of loose words & muddled mindfulness, unalert, unconcentrated, their minds scattered, their faculties left wide open.

Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:

By leaving your body unprotected,

being immersed in wrong view,

conquered by sloth & torpor,

you go under M훮ra's sway.

Therefore,

with protected mind,

ranging in right resolve,

honoring right view,

knowing rise-&-fall,

conquering sloth & torpor, a monk

leaves all

bad destinations

behind.
