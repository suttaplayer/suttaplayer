Udāna 2:5 THE LAY FOLLOWER (UPĀSAKA SUTTA)

I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery. And on that occasion a certain lay follower from Icchānaṅgalaka had arrived in Sāvatthī on some business affairs. Having settled his affairs in Sāvatthī, he went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there, the Blessed One said to him, 'At long last you have managed to come here.'

'For a long time, lord, have I wanted to come see the Blessed One, but being involved in one business affair after another, I have not been able to do so.'

Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:

How blissful it is, for one who has nothing,

who has mastered the Dhamma,

is learned.

See him suffering, one who has something,

a person bound in body

with people.
