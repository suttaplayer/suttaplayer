Udāna 1:6 MAHĀ KASSAPA (KASSAPA SUTTA)

I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rājagaha at the Bamboo Forest, the Squirrels' Sanctuary. And on that occasion Venerable Mahā Kassapa was staying at the Pipphali Cave, afflicted, in pain, & seriously ill. Then, at a later time, he recovered from his illness. When he had recovered from the illness, the thought occurred to him: 'What if I were to go into Rājagaha for alms?'

Now on that occasion 500 devatās were in a state of eagerness for the chance to give alms to Venerable Mahā Kassapa. But Venerable Mahā Kassapa, turning down those 500 devatās, early in the morning adjusted his under robe and–carrying his bowl & robes–went into Rājagaha for alms along the streets of the poor, the streets of the indigent, the streets of the weavers. The Blessed One saw that Venerable Mahā Kassapa had gone into Rājagaha for alms along the streets of the poor, the streets of the indigent, the streets of the weavers.

Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:

Supporting no others,

unknown,

tamed, established

in what is essential,

effluents ended,

anger disgorged:

He's what I call

a brahman.
