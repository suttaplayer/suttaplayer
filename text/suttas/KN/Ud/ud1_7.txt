Udāna 1:7 AJA (AJA SUTTA)

I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Pāva at the Ajakalāpaka [Herd-of-Goats] shrine, the dwelling of the Ajakalāpaka spirit. And on that occasion, in the pitch-black darkness of the night, the Blessed One was sitting in the open air, and the rain was falling in scattered drops.

Then the Ajakalāpaka spirit–wanting to cause fear, terror, & horripilation in the Blessed One–went to him and, on arrival, not far from him, three times made a commotion & pandemonium: 'Commotion & pandemonium! Commotion & pandemonium! Commotion & pandemonium!–That's a goblin for you, contemplative!'

Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:

When,

with regard to his own qualities,

a brahman is one

who has gone beyond,

he transcends this goblin

and his pandemonium.
