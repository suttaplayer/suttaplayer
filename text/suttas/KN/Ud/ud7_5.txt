Udāna 7:5 THE DWARF (LAKUṆṬHA SUTTA)

I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery. And on that occasion Venerable Bhaddiya the Dwarf, following behind a large number of monks, was going to the Blessed One. From afar, the Blessed One saw Venerable Bhaddiya the Dwarf coming, following behind a large number of monks: ugly, unsightly, stunted, treated with condescension by most of the monks. On seeing him, the Blessed One addressed the monks, 'Monks, do you see that monk coming from afar, following behind a large number of monks: ugly, unsightly, stunted, treated with condescension by most of the monks?'

'Yes, lord.'

'That, monks, is a monk of great power, great might. The attainment already attained by that monk is not of a sort easily attained. And by means of it he has reached & remains in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness, knowing & realizing it for himself right in the here-&-now.'

Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:

Faultless,

canopied in white,

the single-spoked chariot rolls along.

See him coming, untroubled:

one whose stream is cut,

free from bonds.
