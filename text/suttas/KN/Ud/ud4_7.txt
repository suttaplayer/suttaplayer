Udāna 4:7 SĀRIPUTTA (SĀRIPUTTA SUTTA)

I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery. And on that occasion Venerable Sāriputta was sitting not far from the Blessed One–his legs crossed, his body held erect–modest, content, solitary, unentangled, his persistence aroused, devoted to the heightened mind. The Blessed One saw Venerable Sāriputta sitting not far away–his legs crossed, his body held erect–modest, content, solitary, unentangled, his persistence aroused, devoted to the heightened mind.

Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:

Of heightened awareness & heedful,

the sage trained in sagacity's way:

He has no sorrows, one who is Such,

calmed & ever mindful.
