Udāna 6:7 SUBHŪTI (SUBHŪTI SUTTA)

I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery. And on that occasion Venerable Subhūti was sitting not far from the Blessed One, his legs crossed, his body held erect, having attained a concentration free from directed thought. The Blessed One saw Venerable Subhūti sitting not far away, his legs crossed, his body held erect, having attained a concentration free from directed thought.

Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:

Whose thoughts are

vaporized,

well-dealt-with

within,

without trace–

going beyond that tie,

perceiving the formless,

overcoming

four yokes,

one doesn't go

to birth.
