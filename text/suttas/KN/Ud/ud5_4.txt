Udāna 5:4 BOYS (KUMĀRA SUTTA)

I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery. And on that occasion, a large number of boys on the road between Sāvatthī & Jeta's Grove were catching fish. Then early in the morning the Blessed One adjusted his under robe and–carrying his bowl & robes–went into Sāvatthī for alms. He saw the large number of boys on the road between Sāvatthī & Jeta's Grove catching little fish. Seeing them, he went up to them and, on arrival, said to them, 'Boys, do you fear pain? Do you dislike pain?'

'Yes, lord, we fear pain. We dislike pain.'

Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:

If you fear pain,

if you dislike pain,

don't anywhere do an evil deed

in open or in secret.

If you're doing or will do

an evil deed,

you won't escape pain

catching up

as you run away.
