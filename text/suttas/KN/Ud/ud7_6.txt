Udāna 7:6 THE ENDING OF CRAVING (TAṆHĀKHAYA SUTTA)

I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery. And on that occasion Venerable Aññāta Kondañña was sitting not far from the Blessed One, his legs crossed, his body held erect, reflecting on [his] release through the total ending of craving. The Blessed One saw Venerable Aññāta Kondañña sitting not far away, his legs crossed, his body held erect, reflecting on [his] release through the total ending of craving.

Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:

For someone with no root, no soil, no leaves

–how creepers?

Who's fit to criticize him?–

the enlightened one freed

from bonds.

Even devas praise him.

Even by Brahmā he's praised.
