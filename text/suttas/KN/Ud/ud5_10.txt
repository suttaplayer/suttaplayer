Udāna 5:10 CŪḶA PANTHAKA (PANTHAKA SUTTA)

I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery. And on that occasion Venerable Cūḷa Panthaka was sitting not far from the Blessed One, his legs crossed, his body held erect, with mindfulness established to the fore. The Blessed One saw Venerable Cūḷa Panthaka sitting not far away, his legs crossed, his body held erect, with mindfulness established to the fore.

Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:

With steady body,

steady awareness,

–whether standing, sitting, or lying down–

a monk determined on mindfulness

gains one distinction

after another.

Having gained one distinction

after another,

he goes where the King of Death

can't see.
