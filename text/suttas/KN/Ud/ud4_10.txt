Udāna 4:10 SĀRIPUTTA (SĀRIPUTTA SUTTA)

I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery. And on that occasion Venerable Sāriputta was sitting not far from the Blessed One–his legs crossed, his body held erect–reflecting on the peace within himself. The Blessed One saw Venerable Sāriputta sitting not far away–his legs crossed, his body held erect–reflecting on the peace within himself.

Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:

For the monk whose mind is

peaceful, at peace,

whose cord is cut,

birth & the wandering on

are totally ended.

Freed is he

from Māra's bonds.
