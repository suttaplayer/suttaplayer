Udāna 7:2 BHADDIYA (2) (BHADDIYA SUTTA)

I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery. At that time Venerable Sāriputta was–with a variety of approaches–instructing, urging, rousing, & encouraging Venerable Bhaddiya the Dwarf with Dhamma-talk to an even greater extent, as he thought that Bhaddiya was still just a learner.

The Blessed One saw that Venerable Sāriputta was–with a variety of approaches–instructing, urging, rousing, & encouraging Venerable Bhaddiya the Dwarf with Dhamma-talk to an even greater extent, as he thought that Bhaddiya was still just a learner.

Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:

He has cut the cycle,

has gone away

to freedom from longing.

The dried-up stream

no longer flows.

The cycle, cut,

no longer turns.

This, just this,

is the end of stress.
