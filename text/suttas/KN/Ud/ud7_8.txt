Udāna 7:8 KACCĀNA (KACCĀNA SUTTA)

I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery. Now at that time Venerable Mahā Kaccāna was sitting not far from the Blessed One, his legs crossed, his body held erect, having mindfulness immersed in the body well-established to the fore within. The Blessed One saw Venerable Mahā Kaccāna sitting not far away, his legs crossed, his body held erect, having mindfulness immersed in the body well-established to the fore within.

Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:

If one were to have

mindfulness always

established, continually

immersed in the body,

(thinking,)

'It should not be,

it should not be mine;

it will not be,

it will not be mine'–

there,

in that step-by-step dwelling,

one in no long time

would cross over

attachment.
