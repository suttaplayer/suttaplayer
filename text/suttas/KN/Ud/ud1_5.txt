Udāna 1:5 BRAHMANS (BRĀHMAṆA SUTTA)

I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery. And on that occasion Venerable Sāriputta, Venerable Mahā Moggallāna, Venerable Mahā Kassapa, Venerable Mahā Kaccāna, Venerable Mahā Koṭṭhita, Venerable Mahā Kappina, Venerable Mahā Cunda, Venerable Anuruddha, Venerable Revata, and Venerable Nanda went to the Blessed One. The Blessed One saw them coming from afar and, on seeing them, addressed the monks, 'Monks, those are brahmans who are coming. Monks, those are brahmans who are coming.'

When this was said, a certain monk who was a brahman by birth said to the Blessed One, 'To what extent, lord, is one a brahman? And which are the qualities that make one a brahman?'

Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:

Having banished evil qualities,

those who go about ever mindful,

awakened, their fetters ended:

They, in the world,

are truly brahmans.
