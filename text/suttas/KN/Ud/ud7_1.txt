Udāna 7:1 BHADDIYA (1) (BHADDIYA SUTTA)

I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery. At that time Venerable Sāriputta was–with a variety of approaches–instructing, urging, rousing, & encouraging Venerable Bhaddiya the Dwarf with Dhamma-talk. As Venerable Bhaddiya the Dwarf was–with a variety of approaches–being instructed, urged, roused, & encouraged by Venerable Sāriputta with Dhamma-talk, his mind, through lack of clinging or sustenance, was released from the effluents.

The Blessed One saw that as Venerable Bhaddiya the Dwarf was–with a variety of approaches–being instructed, urged, roused, & encouraged by Venerable Sāriputta with Dhamma-talk, his mind, through lack of clinging or sustenance, was released from the effluents.

Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:

Above, below, everywhere released,

he doesn't focus on 'I am this.'

Thus released, he crosses the flood

not crossed before,

for the sake of no further becoming.
