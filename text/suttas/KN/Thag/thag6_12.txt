Theragāthā 6:12  BRAHMADATTA

Whence is there anger

in one without anger

tamed, calmed, living in tune,

released through right knowing,

Such?

You make things worse

when you flare up

at someone who's angry.

Whoever doesn't flare up

at someone who's angry

wins a battle

hard to win.

You live for the good of both

—your own, the other's—

when, knowing the other's provoked,

you mindfully grow calm.

When you work the cure of both

—your own, the other's—

those who think you a fool

know nothing of Dhamma.

If anger arises,

reflect on the saw simile.

If craving for savor,

remember the son's-flesh simile.

If your mind runs loose

after sensual pleasures

& states of becoming,

quickly restrain it with mindfulness

as you would a bad ox

eating grain.
