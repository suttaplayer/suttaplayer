Theragāthā 3:15  HĀRITA

Whoever wants to do later

what he should have done first,

falls away from the easeful state

& later repents.

One should speak

as one would act,

& not

as one wouldn't.

When one speaks without acting,

the wise, they can tell.

How very easeful:

unbinding,

as taught by the Rightly

Self-awakened One—

sorrowless,

dustless,

secure,

where stress

& suffering

cease.
