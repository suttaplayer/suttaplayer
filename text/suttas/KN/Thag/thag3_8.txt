Theragāthā 3:8  YASOJA

His limbs knotted

like a kālā plant,

his body lean

& lined with veins,

knowing moderation

in food & drink:

the man of undaunted heart.

Touched by gnats

& horseflies

in the wilds,

the great wood,

like an elephant

at the head of a battle:

He, mindful,

should stay there,

endure.

One alone is like Brahmā,

two, like devas,

three, like a village,

more than that:

a hullabaloo.
