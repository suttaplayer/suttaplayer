Theragāthā 3:5  MĀTAṄGAPUTTA

It's too cold,

too hot,

too late in the evening—

people who say this,

shirking their work:

The moment passes them by.

Whoever regards cold & heat

as no more than grass,

doing his manly duties,

won't fall away

from ease.

With my chest

I push through wild grasses—

spear-grass,

ribbon-grass,

rushes—

cultivating a heart

bent on seclusion.
