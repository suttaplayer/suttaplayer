Theragāthā 10:7  GOTAMA

You should know what's to your benefit.

You should take a good look

at the Buddha's word

& at what's fitting here

for one who has entered

on the contemplative life.

An admirable friend right here,

undertaking the complete training,

& obedience to teachers:

This is fitting

for a contemplative.

Respect for the Buddhas,

honoring the Dhamma

as it has come to be,

& thinking highly of the Saṅgha:

This is fitting

for a contemplative.

Fitting behavior & range of association,

a livelihood purified, blameless,

the establishing of the mind:

This is fitting

for a contemplative.

Virtuous in what you do

& what you abstain from doing,

inspiring comportment,

commitment to the heightened mind:

This is fitting

for a contemplative.

Wilderness lodgings,

secluded, with next-to-no noise,

right for sages to resort to:

This is fitting

for a contemplative.

Virtue, learning,

investigating

phenomena,

mental qualities,

as they have come to be:

This is fitting

for a contemplative.

You should develop

inconstancy,

the perception of not-self,

the perception of unattractiveness,

& distaste for the world:

This is fitting

for a contemplative.

You should develop

the factors for awakening,

the bases for success,

the faculties,

& the noble eightfold path:

This is fitting

for a contemplative.

A sage should abandon craving,

should cut through the effluents, root & all,

should dwell fully released:

This is fitting

for a contemplative.
