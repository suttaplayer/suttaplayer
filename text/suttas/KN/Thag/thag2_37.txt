Theragāthā 2:37  SOṆA POṬIRIYAPUTTA

It's not for sleeping,

the night garlanded

with zodiac stars.

The night, for one who knows,

is for staying awake.

If I were to fall from my elephant's shoulder,

and a tusker trampled me,

death in battle would be better for me,

than that I, defeated,

survive.
