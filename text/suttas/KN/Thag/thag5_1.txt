Theragāthā 5:1  RĀJADATTA

I, a monk,

gone to the charnel ground,

saw a woman cast away,

discarded

there in the cemetery.

Though some were disgusted,

seeing her—dead, evil—

lust

appeared,

as if I were blind

to the oozings.

In less time than it takes

for rice to cook,

I got out of that place.

Mindful, alert, I

sat down to one side.

Then apt attention arose in me,

the drawbacks appeared,

disenchantment stood

at an even keel:

With that, my heart was released.

See the Dhamma's true rightness!

The three knowledges

have been attained;

the Awakened One's bidding,

done.
