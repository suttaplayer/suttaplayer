Theragāthā 2:30  KAṆHADINNA

Men of integrity

have been attended to,

the Dhamma repeatedly

listened to.

Having listened,

I followed the straight way,

the plunge into deathlessness.

Passion for becoming,

having been killed by me,

no further such passion

is found in me.

It neither was

nor will be

nor is found in me

even now.
