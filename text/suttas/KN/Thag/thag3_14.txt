Theragāthā 3:14  GOTAMA

While wandering on

I went to hell;

went again & again

to the world of the hungry ghosts;

stayed countless times, long,

in the pain of the animal womb;

enjoyed

the human state;

went to heaven

from time to time;

settled in the elements of form,

the elements of formlessness,

neither perception, perception-less.

Ways of taking birth

are now known:

devoid of essence,

unstable,

conditioned,

always blown along.

Knowing them

as born from my self,

mindful

I went right to peace.
