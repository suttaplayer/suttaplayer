Theragāthā 4:8  RĀHULA

In both ways

consummate,

I'm known as Rāhula

the Fortunate:

because     I'm the son of the Buddha,

because     I've the eye that sees Dhammas,

because     my effluents are ended,

because     I've no further becoming.

I'm deserving of offerings,

a worthy one

a three-knowledge man,

one with sight

of the deathless.

Those

blinded       by sensuality

covered       by the net,

veiled       by the veil of craving,

bound       by the Kinsman of the heedless,

are like fish in the mouth of a trap.

Throwing that sensuality aside,

cutting through Māra's bond,

pulling out craving, root & all,

cooled am I.

Unbound.
