Theragāthā 14:1  REVATA'S FAREWELL

Since I went forth

from home into homelessness,

I haven't known

an ignoble, aversive resolve.

'May these beings

be destroyed,

be slaughtered,

fall into pain'—

I've not known this resolve

in this long, long time.

But I have known goodwill,

unlimited,

fully developed,

nurtured step after step,

as taught by the One

Awake:

to all, a friend;

to all, a comrade;

for all beings, sympathetic.

And I develop a mind of goodwill,

delighting in non-malevolence

—always.

Unvanquished, unshaken,

I gladden the mind.

I develop the sublime abiding,

not frequented by

the lowly.

Attaining no-thinking,

the disciple of the Rightly

Self-awakened One

is endowed with noble silence

straightaway.

As a mountain of rock

is unmoving,

firmly established,

so a monk,

with the ending of delusion,

like a mountain,

doesn't quake.

To a person without blemish,

in constant quest of what's pure,

a hair-tip of evil

seems a storm cloud.

As a frontier fortress is guarded

within & without,

you should safeguard yourselves.

Don't let the moment

pass you by.

I don't delight in death,

don't delight in living.

I await my time

like a worker his wage.

I don't delight in death,

don't delight in living.

I await my time,

mindful, alert.

The Teacher has been served by me;

the Awakened One's bidding,

done;

the heavy load,       laid down;

the guide to becoming,   uprooted.

And the goal for which I went forth

from home life into homelessness

I've reached:

the end

of all fetters.

Attain consummation

through heedfulness:

That is my message.

So then, I'm about to

unbind.

I'm released

everywhere.
