Theragāthā 10:1  KĀLUDĀYIN

Covered in embers now are the trees,

shedding their canopy, lord, in search of fruit.

As if flaring up, they glow.

The time, great hero, partakes of savors.

The trees in bloom, delightful,

waft delights

all around, in all directions,

dropping their petals in hope of fruit.

Now, O hero, is the time to set forth.

Neither too cold nor too hot:

pleasant the season, lord, fit for a journey.

Let them see you—the Sakyans & Koliyans—

facing west, crossing in the Rohiṇī.

In hope they plow the field.

In hope the seed is sown.

In hope do merchants go to sea,

bringing back wealth.

Let the hope in which I stand bear fruit.

Again & again      they sow the seed.

Again & again      the deva-kings rain.

Again & again      farmers plow the fields.

Again & again      grain comes to the kingdom.

Again & again      beggars wander.

Again & again      lords of giving give.

Again & again      having given, the lords of giving

again & again      go to the heavenly place.

Truly, an enlightened one of deep discernment

cleanses, back for seven generations,

the family in which he's born.

I would imagine you to be Sakka, the deva of devas

for you engendered a sage truly named.

Suddhodana is the name of the Great Seer's father,

and Māyā name of the Buddha's mother

who, having nurtured the bodhisatta with her womb,

at the break-up of the body, rejoices in the threefold divine realm.

She, Gotamī, having passed away,

having fallen away from here,

is now endowed with heavenly sensual pleasures.

She rejoices in the five strings of sensuality,

surrounded by those groups of devas.

I am the son of the Buddha,

who endures what is hard to endure—

Aṅgīrasa: incomparable, Such.

You, Sakka, are my father's father.

In the Dhamma, Gotama,

you are my grandfather.
