Theragāthā 2:32  SIVAKA

Inconstant little houses:

now here,

now there,       again

& again,

I sought the house-builder.

Painful is birth, again

& again.

House-builder, you're seen!

You will not build a house again.

All your rafters are broken,

and your gables torn down.

Released from restriction, the mind

will

be blown out

right here.
