Theragāthā 2:47  ANŪPAMA

Coming into the conceit of delight, the mind

impales itself on a stake.

Wherever's a stake, a chopping block,

there, only there, you turn.

You, mind, I call an unlucky die.

You, I call a mind-traitor.

You've gained a Teacher hard to gain.

Don't urge me on to my loss.
