Theragāthā 11  SAṄKICCA

What do you want in the woods, my boy,

like a bird exposed to the rain?

Monsoons refresh you,

for seclusion is for those in jhāna.

As the monsoon wind

drives the clouds in the rainy season,

so thoughts concerned with seclusion

impel me.

A black crow

making its home in a charnel ground

inspires within me

mindfulness in—

based on dispassion for—

the body.

One whom others don't guard,

who doesn't guard others:

He is a monk

who lies down in ease,

unconcerned with sensual passions.

With clear waters &

massive boulders,

frequented by monkeys &

deer,

covered with moss &

water weeds:

Those rocky crags

refresh me.

I've lived in wildernesses,

canyons, & caves,

isolated dwellings

frequented by predator & prey,

but never have I known

an ignoble, aversive resolve:

'May these beings

be destroyed,

be slaughtered,

fall into pain.'

The Teacher has been served by me;

the Awakened One's bidding,

done;

the heavy load,       laid down;

the guide to becoming,     uprooted.

And the goal for which I went forth

from home life into homelessness

I've reached:

the end

of all fetters.

I don't delight in death,

don't delight in living.

I await my time

as a worker his wage.

I don't delight in death,

don't delight in living.

I await my time,

mindful, alert.
