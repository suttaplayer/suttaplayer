Theragāthā 5:8  VAKKALI

Stricken by sharp, wind-like pains,

you, monk, living in the forest grove

—harsh, with limited range for alms—

what, what will you do?

Suffusing my body

with abundant rapture & joy,

& enduring what's harsh,

I'll stay in the grove.

Developing the establishings of mindfulness,

strengths, faculties,

the factors for awakening,

I'll stay in the grove.

Reflecting on those who are resolute,

their persistence aroused,

constantly firm in their effort,

united in concord,

I'll stay in the grove.

Recollecting the One Self-awakened,

self-tamed & centered,

untiring both day & night,

I'll stay

in the grove.
