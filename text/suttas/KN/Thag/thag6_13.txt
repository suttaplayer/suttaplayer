Theragāthā 6:13  SIRIMAṆḌA

Rain soddens what's covered

& doesn't sodden what's exposed.

So open up what's covered up,

so that it won't get soddened by the rain.

Attacked by death

is the world,

surrounded by aging,

beset by the arrow of craving,

always obscured by desire.

Attacked by death

is the world,

& encircled by aging,

constantly beaten, with no shelter,

like a thief

sentenced to punishment.

They encroach like masses of flame,

these three:

death, aging, & illness.

There's no strength to confront them,

no speed to run away.

Make the day not-in-vain,

a little or a lot.

However much

the day passes,

that's how much less

is life.

Your last day approaches.

This isn't your time

to be heedless.
