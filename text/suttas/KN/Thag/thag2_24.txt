Theragāthā 2:24  VALLIYA

What needs to be done

with firm persistence,

what needs to be done

by one who hopes for awakening,

that I will do.

I will not fail.

See: persistence & striving!

You show me the path:

the straight,

the plunge into deathlessness.

I, through sagacity,

will reach it, know it,

as the stream of the Ganges,

the sea.
