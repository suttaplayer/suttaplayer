Theragāthā 16:7  BHADDIYA KĀLIGODHĀYAPUTTA

Whatever the fine clothes I wore

when astride the elephant's neck,

whatever the fine rice I ate, the pure meat sauce,

today—fortunate, persevering,

delighting in whatever falls into his bowl,

Bhaddiya, son of Godhā,

does jhāna without clinging.

Wearing cast-off cloth, persevering,

delighting in whatever falls into his bowl,

Bhaddiya, son of Godhā,

does jhāna without clinging.

Going for alms, persevering,

delighting in whatever falls into his bowl,

Bhaddiya, son of Godhā,

does jhāna without clinging.

Wearing only one triple set of robes, persevering…

Bypassing no donors on his alms round, persevering…

Eating only one meal a day, persevering…

Eating from the bowl, persevering…

Refusing food brought afterwards, persevering…

Living in the wilderness, persevering…

Living at the foot of a tree, persevering…

Living in the open air, persevering…

Living in a cemetery, persevering…

Accepting whatever lodging he's assigned, persevering,

Not lying down, persevering,

delighting in whatever falls into his bowl,

Bhaddiya, son of Godhā,

does jhāna without clinging.

Modest, persevering…

Content, persevering…

Secluded, persevering…

Unentangled, persevering…

Energy aroused, persevering,

delighting in whatever falls into his bowl,

Bhaddiya, son of Godhā,

does jhāna without clinging.

Abandoning a 100-carat bowl of bronze

and a 100-weight bowl of gold,

I took instead a bowl of clay:

That was my second consecration.

In the midst of high encircling walls,

strong battlements & gates,

guarded by men with swords in hand—

trembling

I used to live.

Today, fortunate, unafraid,

with fear & terror abandoned,

Bhaddiya, son of Godhā,

having plunged into the forest,

does jhāna.

Standing firm in the aggregate of virtue,

developing mindfulness & discernment,

step by step I attained

the ending of all fetters.
