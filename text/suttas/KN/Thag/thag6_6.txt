Theragāthā 6:6  SAPPADĀSA

Twenty five years since my going forth,

and no peace of awareness

—not a finger-snap's worth—

attained.

Having gained no oneness of mind,

I was wracked with lust.

Wailing, with my arms upheld,

I ran amok from my dwelling—

'Or… or shall I take the knife?

What's the use of life to me?

If I were to renounce the training,

what sort of death would I have?'

So, taking a razor,

I sat down on a bed.

And there was the razor,

placed ready to cut my own vein,

when apt attention arose in me,

the drawbacks appeared,

disenchantment stood

at an even keel:

With that, my heart was released.

See the Dhamma's true rightness!

The three knowledges

have been attained;

the Awakened One's bidding,

done.
