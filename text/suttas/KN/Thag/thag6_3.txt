Theragāthā 6:3  MAHĀNĀGA

One in whom respect for his fellows in the holy life

is not found,

wastes away from the True Dhamma

like a fish in next to no water.

One in whom respect for his fellows in the holy life

is not found,

doesn't grow in the True Dhamma,

like a rotten seed in a field.

One in whom respect for his fellows in the holy life

is not found,

is far away from unbinding

in the teaching of the Dhamma king.

One in whom respect for his fellows in the holy life

is found,

doesn't waste away from the True Dhamma

like a fish in plentiful water.

One in whom respect for his fellows in the holy life

is found,

grows in the True Dhamma,

like an excellent seed in a field.

One in whom respect for his fellows in the holy life

is found,

stands right in the presence of unbinding

in the teaching of the Dhamma king.
