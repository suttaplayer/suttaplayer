Theragāthā 2:11  MAHĀ CUNDA

Listening well increases learning.

What is learned increases discernment.

Through discernment one knows the goal.

When known, the goal brings bliss.

Stay in isolated lodgings;

live liberated from fetters.

If you don't attain delight there,

then live in the Saṅgha,

your mind protected

& mindful.
