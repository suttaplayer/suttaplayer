Theragāthā 2:36  KHITAKA

Whose mind, standing like rock,

doesn't shake,

dispassionate for things that spark passion,

unprovoked by things that spark provocation?

When one's mind is developed like this,

from where can there come to him

suffering & stress?

My mind, standing like rock,

doesn't shake,

dispassionate for things that spark passion,

unprovoked by things that spark provocation.

When my mind is developed like this,

from where can there come to me

suffering & stress?
