Theragāthā 7:1  SUNDARA SAMUDDA & THE COURTESAN

Ornamented, finely clothed,

garlanded, adorned,

her feet stained red with lac,

she wore slippers:

a courtesan.

Stepping out of her slippers—

her hands raised before me,

palm-to-palm over her heart—

she softly, tenderly,

in measured words

spoke to me first:

'You are young, recluse.

Heed my message:

Partake of human sensuality.

I will give you luxury.

Truly I vow to you,

I will tend to you as to a fire.

When we are old,

both leaning on canes,

then we will both become recluses,

winning the benefits of both worlds.'

And seeing her before me—

a courtesan, ornamented, finely clothed,

hands palm-to-palm over her heart—

like a snare of death laid out,

apt attention arose in me,

the drawbacks appeared,

disenchantment stood

at an even keel:

With that, my heart was released.

See the Dhamma's true rightness!

The three knowledges

have been attained;

the Buddha's bidding,

done.
