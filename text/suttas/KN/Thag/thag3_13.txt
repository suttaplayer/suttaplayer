Theragāthā 3:13  ABHIBHŪTA

Listen, kinsmen, all of you,

as many as are assembled here.

I will teach you the Dhamma:

Painful is birth,

again & again.

Rouse yourselves.

Go forth.

Apply yourselves

to the Awakened One's bidding.

Scatter the army of Death

as an elephant would

a shed made of reeds.

He who,

in this Dhamma & Vinaya,

stays heedful,

abandoning birth,

the wandering-on,

will put an end

to suffering & stress.
