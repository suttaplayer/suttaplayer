Theragāthā 6:2  TEKICCHAKĀNI

The grain: harvested.

The rice: gone to be threshed.

But I don't get any alms.

How will I get by?

Confident, recollect

the immeasurable Buddha.

Your body pervaded with rapture,

you'll be at the height

of continual joy.

Confident, recollect

the immeasurable Dhamma.

Your body pervaded with rapture,

you'll be at the height

of continual joy.

Confident, recollect

the immeasurable Saṅgha.

Your body pervaded with rapture,

you'll be at the height

of continual joy.

You live in the open air.

Cold are these wintry nights.

Don't suffer, overcome with the cold.

Go into your hut, with its fastened bolt.

I'll fasten the four

immeasurables.

With them, I'll dwell

in comfort.

I won't suffer from the cold,

dwelling

unperturbed.
