Theragāthā 2:27  NANDAKA

Just as a fine thoroughbred steed

stumbling, regains its stance,

feeling all the more urgency,

& draws its burden

undaunted.

In the same way, remember me:

consummate in vision,

a disciple of the Rightly

Self-awakened One,

the Awakened One's thoroughbred child,

his son.
