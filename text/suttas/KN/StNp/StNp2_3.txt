2:3 Â SHAME

One who,

flouting, despising

a sense of shame,

saying, 'I am your friend,'

but not grasping

what he could do [to help]:

Know him as

'Not one of mine.'

One who,

among friends,

speaks endearing words

to which he doesn't conform,

the wise recognize

as speaking without doing.

He's not a friend

who's always wary,

suspecting a split,

focusing just on your weakness.

But him on whom you can depend,

like a child on its parent's breast:

That's a true friend

whom others can't split from you.

Carrying one's manly burden,

the fruits & rewards develop

the conditions that make for joy,

the bliss that brings praise.

Drinking the savor of seclusion,

the savor of calm,

one is freed from evil, devoid

of distress,

refreshed with the savor

of rapture in the Dhamma.
