4:4  THE PURE OCTET

'I see the pure, the supreme,

free from disease.

It's in connection

with what's seen

that a person's purity

is.'

Understanding thus,

having known the 'supreme,'

& remaining focused

on purity,

one falls back on that knowledge.

If it's in connection

with what is seen

that a person's purity is,

or if stress is abandoned

in connection with knowledge,

then a person with acquisitions

is purified

in connection with something else,

for his view betrays that

in the way he asserts it.

No brahman

says purity

comes in connection

with anything else.

Unsmeared with regard

to what's seen, heard, sensed,

habits or practices,

merit or evil,

not creating

anything here,

he's let go

of what he'd embraced.

Abandoning          what's first,

they depend on     what's next.

Following perturbation,

they don't cross over the bond.

They embrace & reject

—like a monkey releasing a branch

to seize at another—

a person undertaking practices on his own,

goes high & low,

latched onto perception.

But having clearly known

through vedas, having encountered

the Dhamma,

one deeply discerning

doesn't go

high & low.

He's enemy-free

with regard to     all things

seen, heard, or sensed.

By whom, with what,

should he

be pigeonholed

here in the world?

—one who has seen in this way,

who goes around

open.

They don't theorize, don't yearn,

don't proclaim 'utter purity.'

Untying the tied-up knot of grasping,

they don't form a desire

anywhere in the world.

The brahman

gone beyond territories,

has nothing that

—on knowing or seeing—

he's grasped.

Unimpassionate          for passion,

not impassioned          for dis-,

he has nothing here

that he's grasped as supreme.
