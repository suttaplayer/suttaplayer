3:6  SABHIYA

I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rājagaha in the Bamboo Forest, the Squirrels' Sanctuary. Now on that occasion, questions had been assigned to Sabhiya the wanderer by a devatā who was a former relative of his: 'Sabhiya, if any contemplative or brahman, when asked these questions, answers them, live the holy life in his presence.' Then Sabhiya the wanderer, having learned these questions in the presence of that devatā, went to those who had communities & groups, who were the teachers of groups, well-known, prestigious, founders of sects, well-regarded by people at large—i e, Pūraṇa Kassapa, Makkhali Gosāla, Ajita Kesakambalin, Pakudha Kaccāyana, Sañjaya Velaṭṭhaputta, & the Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta—and asked them the questions. But they, being asked the questions by Sabhiya the wanderer, were unable to answer. Unable to answer, they showed anger, aversion, & displeasure, and even turned the questions back on Sabhiya the wanderer.

The thought occurred to Sabhiya the wanderer, 'These venerable contemplatives & brahmans with communities & groups, who are the teachers of groups, well-known, prestigious, founders of sects, well-regarded by people at large—i e, Pūraṇa Kassapa … & the Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta—when asked these questions by me are unable to answer. Unable to answer, they show anger, aversion, & displeasure, and even turn the questions back on me. What if I were to revert to the lower life and partake of sensual pleasures?'

But then the thought occurred to him, 'There is still this Gotama the contemplative. He has a community & group, he is the teacher of a group, well-known, prestigious, founder of a sect, well-regarded by people at large. What if I, having gone to him, were to ask him these questions?'

Then the thought occurred to Sabhiya the wanderer, 'Now, those venerable contemplatives & brahmans—Pūraṇa Kassapa … & the Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta—are old, elderly, aged, along in their years, at an advanced stage of life, elders, senior, long gone forth, with communities & groups, teachers of groups, well-known, prestigious, founders of sects, well-regarded by people at large: Even they, when asked these questions by me, were unable to answer. Unable to answer, they showed anger, aversion, & displeasure, and even turned the questions back on me. So how could this Gotama the contemplative answer when asked these questions? He is both young in age and newly gone forth.'

But then the thought occurred to him, 'Gotama the contemplative is not to be despised as 'young' or treated with contempt. Even though young, he is of great power & great might. What if I, having gone to him, were to ask him these questions?'

So Sabhiya the wanderer set out, headed for Rājagaha. Wandering by stages, he arrived at where the Blessed One was staying near Rājagaha in the Bamboo Forest, the Squirrels' Sanctuary. On arrival, he exchanged courteous greetings with the Blessed One. After an exchange of friendly greetings & courtesies, he sat to one side. As he was sitting there, he addressed the Blessed One in verse:

'Doubtful & uncertain, I have come

desiring to ask questions.

Put an end to them,

when asked them by me.

Answer me     one-by-one,

in line with the Dhamma.'

'Sabhiya,' said the Blessed One,

'you have come from afar,

desiring to ask questions.

I will put an end to them,

when asked them by you.

I will answer you     one-by-one,

in line with the Dhamma.'

Then the thought occurred to Sabhiya the wanderer, 'Isn't is amazing? Isn't it astounding?—how even the leave, of which I didn't receive even a little bit from other contemplatives & brahmans, has been granted to me by Gotama the contemplative.' Gratified, joyful, exultant, enraptured, & happy, he asked the Blessed One a question:

'Having attained what

is one said to be a monk?

In what way is one composed?

And how is one said to be tamed?

How is one called 'awakened'?

Answer, Blessed One, when I've asked you.'

The Buddha:

'Having gone to total unbinding,

having crossed over doubt,

by means of the path accomplished by himself,

having abandoned becoming & non-becoming,

having fulfilled [the task],

further-becoming ended:

He is a monk.

Everywhere equanimous, mindful,

he harms no one in all the world.

A contemplative crossed over, limpid,

he has no swellings: He is composed.

Whose faculties are developed,

within & without,

with regard to all the world,

disenchanted with this world & the next,

he awaits his time, developed: He's tamed.

Having evaluated all theories,

the wandering-on,

dying & reappearing,

having done away with dust & blemish

—pure—

he has attained the ending of birth:

He is called awakened.'

Then Sabhiya the wanderer—delighting in and approving of the Blessed One's words—gratified, joyful, exultant, enraptured & happy, asked the Blessed One a further question:

'Having attained what

is one said to be a brahman?

In what way is one a contemplative,

and how is one 'washed'?

How is one called a nāga?

Answer, Blessed One, when I've asked you.'

The Buddha:

'Having banished all evils,

well-centered, stainless,

firm in mind,

gone entirely          beyond

the wandering-on,

independent, Such:

He's called a brahman.

Calmed, having abandoned

good & evil,

dustless, having known

this world & the next,

gone beyond birth & death,

he is truly called a contemplative—

Such.

Having washed off     all evils

within & without, in     all the world,

with regard to the theories

of beings human & divine,

he goes to no theory:

He's said to be 'washed.'

He does no misdeed

at all in the world.

Having escaped all fetters & bonds,

freed, he's everywhere un-

attached,

truly he's called a nāga—

Such.'

Then Sabhiya the wanderer—delighting in and approving of the Blessed One's words—gratified, joyful, exultant, enraptured, & happy, asked the Blessed One a further question:

'Whom do the awakened

call a field-victor?

In what way is one skilled

and how is one wise?

And how is one called

by the name of 'sage'?

Answer, Blessed One, when I've asked you.'

The Buddha:

'Having examined all fields—

heavenly, human, and fields of the Brahmās—

freed from the root bonds of all fields,

he's truly called a field-victor—

Such.

Having examined all storehouses—

heavenly, human, storehouses of Brahmās—

freed from the root bonds of all storehouses,

he's truly called skillful—

Such.

Having examined all white flowers

within & without,

one of pure discernment

gone beyond dark & bright,

he's truly called wise—

Such.

Knowing false & true Dhamma

within & without, in all the world,

he is worshipped by beings

human & divine.

Having transcended snares & nets,

he is a sage.'

Then Sabhiya the wanderer—delighting in and approving of the Blessed One's words—gratified, joyful, exultant, enraptured & happy, asked the Blessed One a further question:

'Having attained what

is one said to be

an attainer-of-knowledge?

In what way is one well-tested,

and how is one persistent?

Why is one named a thoroughbred?

Answer, Blessed One, when I've asked you.'

The Buddha:

'Having examined all knowledges—

those of brahmans, those of contemplatives—

devoid of passion for all feelings,

gone beyond knowledge:

He's an attainer-of-knowledge.

Having tested objectification

& name-&-form,

within & without, the root of disease,

freed from the root bond of disease,

he's truly called well-tested—

Such.

Abstaining from all evils,

gone beyond the suffering of hell,

he's one with persistence.

He, with persistence, exertion,

is rightly called a hero—

Such.

One truly whose bonds are cut

within & without,

freed from all the root bonds of snares,

truly he's called a thoroughbred—

Such.'

Then Sabhiya the wanderer—delighting in and approving of the Blessed One's words—gratified, joyful, exultant, enraptured & happy, asked the Blessed One a further question:

'Having attained what

is one said to be learned?

In what way is one noble,

and how is one a person of good conduct?

Why is one named a wanderer?

Answer, Blessed One, when I've asked you.'

The Buddha:

'Having heard, having directly known

every Dhamma

for the sake of direct knowing

in the world,

whatever is blameworthy or blameless,

having conquered, free of doubt,

released

everywhere, everywhere

without trouble,

one is said to be learned.

Having cut attachments & effluents,

knowing, he does not come to lie in the womb,

dispelling mud

and the three types of perception,

he goes to no theory:

He is called noble.

Whoever here has attained attainment

with regard to good conduct,

all-skillful, who has learned the Dhamma,

unattached

everywhere,

everywhere his mind released,

he has no irritation:

He is one of good conduct.

Avoiding whatever action there is

that ripens in suffering & stress

—above, below, and even all around

in the middle—

one who goes about, comprehending,

he has put an all-around end to

deceptiveness, conceit,

greed, anger,

name-&-form:

He's called a wanderer,

attained to attainment.'

Then Sabhiya the wanderer—delighting in and approving of the Blessed One's words—gratified, joyful, exultant, enraptured & happy—got up from his seat and, arranging his upper robe over his shoulder and placing his hands palm-to-palm over his heart toward the Blessed One, praised the Blessed One face-to-face with fitting verses:

'One Deeply Discerning,

you have crossed over the flood of darkness

of the three & sixty views leading downward,

dependent on the teachings of contemplatives,

dependent on perceptions

& words of perceptions.

You have gone     to the end,

you have gone     to the further shore

of suffering & stress.

You are a noble one,

rightly self-awakened.

I would imagine that you

have ended the effluents.

Brilliant, thoughtful,

of abundant discernment,

ender of suffering,

you have brought me across.

When you learned of my doubt,

you brought me across my uncertainty.

Homage to you, sage attained

to the attainment of sagacity's ways.

Free from rigidity, Kinsman of the Sun,

you're composed.

The doubt I had before,

you have answered, One with Eyes.

Yes, you are a sage, rightly

self-awakened. You have

no hindrances. Your despairs

are fallen down, cut from the stem.

Cooled, attained to self-control,

steadfast, enduring in truth:

In your words, Nāga of nāgas, great hero,

all devas—including Nāradas and Pabbatas—

delight.

Homage to you, O thoroughbred man,

Homage to you, O superlative man,

in the world with its devas

there's no one to compare with you.

You : Awakened.

You : Teacher.

You : Sage who has conquered Māra.

You : Having cut obsessions,

having crossed over,

bring this generation across.

Your acquisitions transcended,

your effluents torn apart,

you are a lion

free of clinging,

your fear & terror abandoned.

As a lovely lotus

is not smeared by water,

you are not smeared

by good or evil.

Extend your feet, hero:

Sabhiya venerates them,

the feet of the Teacher.

Then Sabhiya the wanderer, bending his head to the Blessed One's feet, said, 'Magnificent, lord! Magnificent! Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned, to reveal what was hidden, to show the way to one who was lost, or to set out a lamp in the darkness so that those with eyes could see forms, in the same way has the Blessed One—through many lines of reasoning—made the Dhamma clear. I go to the Blessed One for refuge, to the Dhamma, & to the Saṅgha of monks. Let me obtain the Going-forth in the Blessed One's presence, let me obtain Acceptance.'

'Anyone, Sabhiya, who has previously belonged to another sect and who desires the Going-forth & Acceptance into this Dhamma & Vinaya, must first undergo probation for four months. If, at the end of four months, the monks feel so moved, they give him the Going-forth & accept him into the monk's state. But I know distinctions among individuals in this matter.'

'Lord, if that is so, I am willing to undergo probation for four years. If, at the end of four years, the monks feel so moved, let them give me the Going-forth & accept me into the monk's state.'

Then Sabhiya the wanderer obtained the Going-forth in the Blessed One's presence, he obtained Acceptance. And not long after his Acceptance—dwelling alone, secluded, heedful, ardent, & resolute—he in no long time reached & remained in the supreme goal of the holy life, for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness, knowing & realizing it for himself in the here-&-now. He knew: 'Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for the sake of this world.' And so Venerable Sabhiya became another one of the arahants.
