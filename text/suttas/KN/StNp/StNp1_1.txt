1:1  THE SNAKE

The monk who subdues his arisen anger

as, with herbs, snake-venom once it has spread,

sloughs off the near shore & far—

as a snake, its decrepit old skin.

The monk who has cut off passion

without leaving a trace,

as he would, plunging into a lake, a lotus,

sloughs off the near shore & far—

as a snake, its decrepit old skin.

without leaving a trace,

drying up the swift-flowing flood,

sloughs off the near shore & far—

as a snake, its decrepit old skin.

without leaving a trace,

as a great flood, a very weak bridge made of reeds,

sloughs off the near shore & far—

as a snake, its decrepit old skin.

in states of becoming

no essence,

as he would,

when examining fig trees,

no flowers,

sloughs off the near shore & far—

who has thus gone beyond

becoming & not-,

sloughs off the near shore & far—

as a snake, its decrepit old skin.

well-dealt with inside

without leaving a trace,

sloughs off the near shore & far—

as a snake, its decrepit old skin.

transcending all

this objectification,

sloughs off the near shore & far—

as a snake, its decrepit old skin.

that 'All this is unreal,'

sloughs off the near shore & far—

without greed, as 'All this is unreal,'

sloughs off the near shore & far—

there are no obsessions

—the roots of unskillfulness totally destroyed—

sloughs off the near shore & far—

there's nothing born of disturbance

that would lead him back to this shore,

sloughs off the near shore & far—

that would act as a cause

for binding him to becoming,

who, untroubled, de-arrowed,

has crossed over doubt,

sloughs off the near shore & far—
