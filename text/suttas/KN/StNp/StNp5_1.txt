5:1  AJITA'S QUESTIONS

With what

is the world shrouded?

Because of what

doesn't it shine?

With what

is it smeared? Tell me.

What

is its great danger & fear?

The Buddha:

With ignorance

the world is shrouded.

Because of stinginess,

heedlessness,

it doesn't shine.

With longing

it's smeared—I tell you.

Suffering-stress:

its great danger & fear.

Ajita:

They flow every which way,

the streams.

What is their blocking,

what their restraint—tell me—

with what are they finally stopped?

The Buddha:

Whatever streams

there are in the world:

Their blocking is

mindfulness, mindfulness

is their restraint—I tell you—

with discernment

they're finally stopped.

Ajita:

Discernment & mindfulness,

name-&-form, dear sir:

Tell me, when asked this,

where are they brought to a halt?

The Buddha:

This question you've asked, Ajita,

I'll answer it for you—

where name-&-form

are brought to a halt

without trace:

With the cessation of consciousness

they're brought

to a halt.

Ajita:

Those here who have fathomed the Dhamma,

those who are learners,

those who are run-of-the-mill:

When you, dear sir, astute,

are asked this,

tell me their manner of life.

The Buddha:

He

should not hanker

for sensual pleasures,

should be limpid in mind.

Skilled in all mental qualities,

he, the monk, should wander

mindfully.
