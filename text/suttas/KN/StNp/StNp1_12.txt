1:12  THE SAGE

Danger is born from intimacy,

a home gives birth to dust.

Free from a home,

free from intimacy:

Such is the vision of the sage.

Who, destroying what's born,

wouldn't plant (again)

or nourish what's taking birth:

They call him the wandering, solitary sage.

He, the great seer

has seen

the state of peace.

Considering the ground,

crushing the seed,

he wouldn't nourish the sap

—truly a sage—

seer of the ending of birth,

abandoning conjecture,

he cannot be classified.

Knowing all dwellings,

not longing for any one anywhere

—truly a sage—

with no coveting, without greed,

he does not build,

for he has gone          beyond.

Conquering     all

knowing     all,

wise.

With regard to     all things:

unsmeared.

Abandoning     all,

in the ending of craving,

released:

The enlightened call him a sage.

With discernment his strength,

well-endowed in habit & practice,

centered,

delighting in jhāna,

mindful,

released from attachments,

free from rigidity, free

from effluent:

The enlightened call him a sage.

The solitary wandering sage,

uncomplacent, unshaken by praise or blame—

unstartled,     like a lion at sounds,

uncaught,          like the wind in a net,

unsmeared,     like a lotus in water,

leader of others, by others unled:

The enlightened call him a sage.

Who becomes

like the pillar at a bathing ford,

when others speak in extremes;

he, without passion,

his senses well-centered:

The enlightened call him a sage.

Truly poised, straight as a shuttle,

he loathes evil actions.

Pondering what is consonant & discordant:

The enlightened call him a sage.

Restrained in mind, he does no evil.

Young & middle-aged,

the sage self-controlled,

never angered, he angers none:

The enlightened call him a sage.

From the best

the middling

the leftovers

he receives alms.

Sustaining himself on what others give,

neither flattering

nor speaking disparagement:

The enlightened call him a sage.

The wandering sage

abstaining from sex,

in youth bound by no one,

abstaining from intoxication

complacency,

totally apart:

The enlightened call him a sage.

Knowing the world,

seeing the highest goal,

crossing the ocean, the flood,

—Such—

his chains broken,

unattached,

without effluent:

The enlightened call him a sage.

These two are different,

they dwell far apart:

the householder supporting a wife

and the unselfish one, of good practices.

Slaying other beings, the householder

is unrestrained.

Constantly the sage protects other beings,

is controlled.

Just as the crested,

blue-necked peacock,

when flying,

never matches

the wild goose

in speed,

even so the householder

never keeps up with the monk—

the sage secluded

in the forest,

doing jhāna.
