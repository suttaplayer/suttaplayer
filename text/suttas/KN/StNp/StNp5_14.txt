5:14  POSĀLA'S QUESTION

To one who reveals the past

—unperturbed,

his doubts cut through—

who has gone to the beyond

of all phenomena,

I've come with a desire for a question.

I ask the Sakyan about the knowledge

of one devoid of perception of forms,

who has abandoned all the body,

every body,

who sees, within & without,

'There is nothing':

How is he

to be led further on?

The Buddha:

The Tathāgata, knowing directly

all stations of consciousness,

knows for one stationed in them

release

& the steps leading there.

Knowing directly

the origin of nothingness

to be the fetter of delight,

one then sees there

clearly.

That's his genuine knowledge—

the brahman who has lived

to fulfillment.
