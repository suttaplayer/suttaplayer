4:9  TO MĀGANDIYA

[Māgandiya, a brahman, offers his daughter to the Buddha, who replies:]

'On seeing [the daughters of Māra]

—Discontent, Craving, & Passion—

there wasn't even the desire for sex.

So what would I want with this,

filled with urine & excrement?

I wouldn't want to touch it

even with my foot.'

Māgandiya:

'If you don't want

this gem of a woman, coveted

by many kings,

then for what sort of viewpoint,

habit, practice, life,

attainment of [further] becoming

do you argue?'

The Buddha:

'I argue for this'

doesn't occur to one

when considering what's grasped

among doctrines.

Looking for what is ungrasped

with regard to views,

and detecting inner peace,

I saw.'

Māgandiya:

'Sage, you speak

of not grasping

at any theorized judgments.

This 'inner peace':

What does it mean?

How is it,

by the enlightened,

proclaimed?'

The Buddha:

'He doesn't speak of purity

in connection with     view,

learning,

knowledge,

habit or practice.

Nor is it found by a person

through lack of view,

of learning,

of knowledge,

of habit or practice.

Letting these go, without grasping,

at peace,

independent,

one wouldn't long for becoming.'

Māgandiya:

'Well, if he doesn't speak of purity

in connection with     view,

learning,

knowledge,

habit or practice.

and it isn't found by a person

through lack of view,

of learning,

of knowledge,

of habit or practice,

it seems to me that this teaching's

simply confused,

for some assume a purity

in terms of

—by means of—

a view.'

The Buddha:

'Asking questions

dependent on view,

you're confused

by the things you have grasped.

And so you don't glimpse

even

the slightest

notion

[of what I am saying].

That's why you think

it's confused.

Whoever supposes

'equal,'

'superior,' or

'inferior,'

by that he'd dispute;

whereas to one unaffected

by these three,

'equal,'

'superior,'

do not occur.

Of what would the brahman say 'true'

or 'false,'

with whom would he dispute?

With whom would he join in dispute,

he in whom 'equal,' 'unequal' are not?

Having abandoned home,

living free from society,

the sage

in villages

creates no intimacies.

Remote from sensuality, not

preferring,

he wouldn't engage with people

in quarrelsome debate.

Those things

aloof from which

he should go about in the world:

The Nāga

wouldn't take them up

& argue for them.

As the prickly lotus

is unsmeared by water & mud,

so the sage,

an exponent of peace,

without greed,

is unsmeared by sensuality &

the world.

An attainer-of-knowledge isn't measured

made proud

by views or what's thought,

for he isn't fashioned of them.

He wouldn't be led

by action, learning;

doesn't reach a conclusion

in any entrenchments.

For one dispassionate toward perception

there are no snares;

for one released by discernment,

no

delusions.

Those who grasp at perceptions & views

go about clashing in the world.'
