5:15  MOGHARĀJA'S QUESTION

Twice now, Sakyan,

I've asked you,

but you, One with Eyes,

haven't answered me.

'When asked the third time,

the divine seer answers':

So I have heard.

This world, the next world,

the Brahmā world with its devas:

I don't know how they're viewed

by the prestigious Gotama.

So to the one who has seen

to the far extreme,

I've come with a desire for a question:

One who regards the world in what way

isn't seen by Death's King?

The Buddha:

Always mindful, Mogharāja,

regard the world as

empty,

having removed any view

in terms of self.

This way

one is above & beyond death.

One who regards the world

in this way

isn't seen by Death's King.
