4:11  QUARRELS & DISPUTES

'From where have there arisen

quarrels, disputes,

lamentation, sorrows, along with stinginess,

conceit & pride, along with divisiveness?

From where have they arisen?

Please tell me.'

'From what is dear

there have arisen

quarrels, disputes,

lamentation, sorrows, along with stinginess,

conceit & pride, along with divisiveness.

Tied up with stinginess

are quarrels & disputes.

In the arising of disputes

is divisiveness.'

'Where is the cause

of things dear in the world,

along with the greeds that go about in the world?

And where is the cause

of the hopes & aims

for the sake of a person's next life?'

'Desires are the cause

of things dear in the world,

along with the greeds that go about in the world.

And here too is the cause

of the hopes & aims

for the sake of a person's next life.'

'Now where is the cause

of desire in the world?

And from where have there arisen

decisions, anger, lies, & perplexity,

and all the qualities

described by the Contemplative?'

'What they call

'appealing' &

'unappealing'

in the world:

In dependence on that,

desire arises.

Having seen becoming & not-

with regard to forms,

a person gives rise to decisions in the world;

anger, lies, & perplexity:

these qualities, too,

when there exists

that very pair.

A person perplexed

should train for the path of knowledge,

for it's in having known

that the Contemplative has spoken

of qualities or dhammas.'

'Where is the cause

of appealing & un-?

When what isn't

do they not exist?

And whatever is meant

by becoming & not- :

Tell me,

Where is their cause?'

'Contact is the cause

of appealing & un-.

When contact isn't,

they do not exist,

along with what's meant

by becoming & not- :

I tell you,

from here is their cause.'

'Now where is the cause

of contact in the world,

and from where have graspings,

possessions, arisen?

When what isn't

does there not exist mine-ness?

When what has disappeared

do contacts not touch?'

'Conditioned by name-&-form

is contact.

In longing do graspings,

possessions have their cause.

When longing isn't,

mine-ness doesn't exist.

When forms have disappeared

contacts don't touch.'

'For one how-arriving

does form disappear?

How do pleasure & pain disappear?

Tell me this.

My heart is set

on knowing how

they disappear.'

'One not percipient of perceptions

not percipient of aberrant perceptions,

not unpercipient,

nor percipient of what's disappeared:

For one thus-arriving,

form disappears—

for objectification-classifications

have their cause in perception.'

'What we have asked,

you've expounded to us.

We ask one thing more.

Please tell it.

Do some of the wise

say that just this much is the utmost,

that purity of spirit is here?

Or do they say

that it's other than this?'

'Some of the wise

say that just this much is the utmost,

that purity of spirit is here.

But some of them,

who say they are skilled,

say it's the moment

with no clinging remaining.

But knowing,

'Having known, they still are dependent,'

the sage ponders dependencies.

On knowing them, released,

he doesn't get into disputes,

doesn't meet with becoming & not-

: He's enlightened.'
