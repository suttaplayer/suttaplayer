2:10  INITIATIVE

Get up!

Sit up!

What's your need for sleep?

And what sleep is there for the afflicted,

pierced by the arrow,

oppressed?

Get up!

Sit up!

Train firmly for the sake of peace.

Don't let the king of death,

—seeing you heedless—

deceive you,

bring you under his sway.

Cross over the attachment

to which human & heavenly beings

remain,     desiring,

tied.

Don't let the moment pass by.

Those for whom the moment is past

grieve, consigned to hell.

Heedlessness is

dust, dust

comes from heedlessness,

has heedlessness

on its heels.

Through heedfulness & clear knowing

you'd remove

your own arrow.
