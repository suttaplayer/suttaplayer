5:11  JATUKAṆṆIN'S QUESTION

Hearing, hero,

of one with no desire for sensuality,

I've come to ask

the one gone beyond the flood,

sensuality-free:

Tell me the state of peace,

Blessed One, Simultaneous Eye.

Tell me

as it actually is.

For the Blessed One lives

having conquered sensuality,

as the radiant sun, in its radiance,

the earth.

Limited my discernment,

O Deeply Discerning.

Teach me to know the Dhamma,

the abandoning here

of birth

& aging.

The Buddha:

Subdue greed for sensuality,

& see renunciation as rest.

Let there be nothing grasped

or rejected by you.

Burn up what's before,

and have nothing for after.

If you don't grasp

at what's in between,

you will go about, calm.

One completely devoid of greed

for name-&-form, brahman,

has

no effluents

by which he would go

under Māra's sway.
