2:9  WITH WHAT VIRTUE?

'With     what virtue,

what behavior,

nurturing     what actions,

would a person become rightly based

and attain the ultimate goal?'

'One should be respectful

of one's superiors

& not envious;

should have a sense of the time

for seeing teachers;

should value the opportunity

when a talk on Dhamma's in progress;

should listen intently

to well-spoken words;

should go at the proper time,

humbly, casting off arrogance,

to one's teacher's presence;

should both recollect & follow

the Dhamma, its meaning,

restraint, & the holy life.

Delighting in     Dhamma,

savoring     Dhamma,

established in     Dhamma,

with a sense of how

to investigate     Dhamma,

one should not speak in ways

destructive     of Dhamma,

should guide oneself

with true, well-spoken words.

Shedding

laughter,chattering,

lamentation,     hatred,

deception,     deviousness,

greed,     pride,

confrontation,     roughness,

astringency,               infatuation,

one should go about free

of intoxication,

with steadfast mind.

Understanding's the heartwood

of well-spoken words;

concentration, the heartwood

of learning & understanding.

When a person is hasty & heedless

his discernment & learning

don't grow.

While those who delight

in the Dhamma taught by the noble ones,

are unsurpassed

in word, action, & mind.

They, established in

calm,

composure, &

concentration,

have reached

what discernment & learning

have as their heartwood.'
