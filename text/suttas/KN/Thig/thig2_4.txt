Therīgāthā 2:4  AḌḌHKĀSĪ

All of the Kāsi countryside:

My fee was equal to that.

Having made that my price,

the town set me as priceless in price.

But then I became disenchanted with my body,

and—disenchanted—dispassionate:

'May I not run again & again

through birth & the wandering-on.'

The three knowledges

have been realized.

The Buddha's bidding

done.
