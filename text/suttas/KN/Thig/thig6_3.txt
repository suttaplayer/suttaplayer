Therīgāthā 6:3  KHEMĀ

Māra:

'You, a beautiful young woman;

I, a young man, full of youth.

Come, Khemā,

let's enjoy ourselves

to the music of a five-piece band.'

Khemā:

'I'm disgusted, ashamed

of this putrid body—

disintegrating, dissolving.

Sensual craving

is rooted out.

Sensual pleasures

are like swords & spears;

the aggregates,

their executioner's block.

What you call sensual delight

is no delight for me.

Everywhere enjoyment

is defeated;

the mass of darkness,

burst.

So know,      Evil One,

that you have been,

End-maker,

struck down.'

Paying homage to the zodiac stars,

tending the fire in the forest,

not knowing it as it actually was,

fools, you conceived it

as purity.

Whereas I

am one who pays homage

to the One Self-awakened,

the utmost man.

I'm one who has done the Teacher's bidding,

entirely released

from sufferings & stress.
