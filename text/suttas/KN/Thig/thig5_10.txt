Therīgāthā 5:10  PAṬĀCĀRĀ

[I thought:]

'Plowing the field with plows,

sowing the ground with seed,

supporting their wives & children,

young men gather up wealth.

So why is it that I,

consummate in virtue,

a doer of the teacher's bidding,

don't gain unbinding?

I'm not lazy or proud.'

Washing my feet, I noticed

the

water.

And in watching it flow from high

to

low,

my heart was composed

like a fine thoroughbred steed.

Then taking a lamp, I entered the hut,

checked the bedding,

sat down on the bed.

And taking a pin, I pulled out the wick:

Like the flame's unbinding

was the liberation

of awareness.
