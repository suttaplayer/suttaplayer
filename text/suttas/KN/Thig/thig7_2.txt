Therīgāthā 7:2  CĀLĀ

Cālā:

Having established mindfulness,

a nun with developed faculties, I

penetrated the peaceful state:

stilling-of-fabrications bliss.

Māra:

'For whose sake

have you shaved your head?

You look like a contemplative

but don't approve of a philosophy,

so why are you wandering here

confused?'

Cālā:

'Outside philosophers place

their confidence in views.

They don't know the Dhamma.

They're not adept in the Dhamma.

But there is

the Awakened One,

born in the Sakyan clan,

a person without peer.

He taught me the Dhamma

for the transcending of views:

stress,

the co-arising of stress,

the overcoming of stress,

& the noble eightfold path

leading to the stilling of stress.

Having heard his words,

I dwell, delighting

in his bidding.

The three knowledges

are attained;

the Buddha's bidding,

done.

Everywhere enjoyment

is defeated;

the mass of darkness,

burst.

So know,     Evil One,

that you have been,

End-maker,

struck down.
