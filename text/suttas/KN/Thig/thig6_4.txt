Therīgāthā 6:4  SUJĀTĀ

Ornamented, well-dressed,

garlanded, sprinkled with sandalwood,

covered all over with jewelry,

surrounded by a group of slave-women,

taking food & drink,

and not a little staple & non-staple food,

leaving the house,

I fetched myself to the pleasure garden.

Having enjoyed ourselves & played there,

we headed back to our home.

I saw in Sāketa a hall at the Añjana wood.

I entered.

Seeing the light of the world,

I, paying homage, sat nearby.

He, the One with Eyes,

from sympathy,

taught me the Dhamma.

Hearing the Great Seer, I

fully penetrated

the truth.

Right there I touched the Dhamma,

dustless, the deathless state.

Then, knowing the True Dhamma,

I went forth

into homelessness.

The three knowledges

are attained.

The Buddha's bidding

is not in vain.
