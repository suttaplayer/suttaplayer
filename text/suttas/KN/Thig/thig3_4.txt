Therīgāthā 3:4  DANTIKĀ & THE ELEPHANT

Coming out from my day's abiding

on Vulture Peak Mountain,

I saw on the bank of the river

an elephant

emerged from its plunge.

A man holding a hook requested:

'Give me your foot.'

The elephant

extended its foot.

The man

got up on the elephant.

Seeing what was untrained now tamed

brought under human control,

with that I centered my mind—

why I'd gone to the woods

in the first place.
