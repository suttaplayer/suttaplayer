Therīgāthā 8  SĪSŪPACĀLĀ

Sīsupacālā:

A nun, consummate in virtue,

her faculties well-restrained,

will reach the state of peace,

a nourishment

that never cloys.

Māra:

The Devas of the Thirty-three,

the Hours, the Contented,

devas who delight in creation,

& devas in control:

Direct your mind there

where you lived before.

Sīsupacālā:

The Devas of the Thirty-three,

the Hours, the Contented,

devas who delight in creation,

& devas in control:

Time & again,

from becoming to becoming,

surrounded by self-identity,

not having gone beyond self-identity,

they flow to birth & death.

The whole world is     burning.

The whole world is     aflame.

The whole world is     blazing.

The whole world is     shaken.

The unshaken, incomparable

—the Dhamma the Buddha taught to me,

of which people run-of-the-mill

don't partake—

that's where my heart

truly delights.

Having heard his words,

I dwell, delighting

in his bidding.

The three knowledges

are attained;

the Buddha's bidding,

done.

Everywhere enjoyment

is defeated;

the mass of darkness,

burst.

So know,     Evil One,

that you have been,

End-maker,

struck down.
