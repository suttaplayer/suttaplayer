Therīgāthā 7:3  UPACĀLĀ

Upacālā:

Having mindfulness, having an eye that sees,

a nun with developed faculties, I

penetrated the peaceful state

of which worthless people

don't partake.

Māra:

Why don't you approve of birth?

One who is born

enjoys sensual pleasures.

Enjoy sensual delight!

Don't later burn with regret.

Upacālā:

For one who is born

there's death,

the cutting-off of hands & feet,

binding, flogging, torment.

One who's born incurs pain.

But there is

the Rightly Awakened One,

the undefeated one,

born in the Sakyan clan.

He taught me the Dhamma

for the transcending of birth:

stress,

the co-arising of stress,

the overcoming of stress,

& the noble eightfold path

leading to the stilling of stress.

Having heard his words,

I dwell, delighting

in his bidding.

The three knowledges

are attained;

the Buddha's bidding,

done.

Everywhere enjoyment

is defeated;

the mass of darkness,

burst.

So know,     Evil One,

that you have been,

End-maker,

struck down.
