Therīgāthā 3:2  UTTAMĀ

Four times, five, I ran amok from my dwelling,

having gained no peace of awareness,

my thoughts out of control.

So I went to a trustworthy nun.

She taught me the Dhamma:

aggregates, sense media, properties.

Hearing the Dhamma,

I did as she said.

For seven days I sat in one spot,

absorbed in rapture & bliss.

On the eighth, I stretched out my legs,

having burst the mass

of darkness.
