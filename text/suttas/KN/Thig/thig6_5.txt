Therīgāthā 6:5  ANOPAMĀ, THE MILLIONAIRE'S DAUGHTER

Born in a high-ranking family

with much property, great wealth,

consummate in complexion & figure,

I was the daughter of Majjha, the treasurer.

Kings' sons sought for me,

rich merchants' sons

longed for me.

One of them sent my father a messenger,

saying, 'Give me Anopamā.

I will give in return

eight times her weight

in jewels & gold.'

But I, having seen

the One Self-awakened,

unsurpassed, excelling the world,

paid homage to his feet,

sat down to one side.

He, Gotama, from sympathy,

taught me the Dhamma.

And as I sat in that very seat,

I attained the third fruit

[of non-return.]

Then I cut off my hair,

and went forth into homelessness.

Today is the seventh day

since I made craving

wither away.
