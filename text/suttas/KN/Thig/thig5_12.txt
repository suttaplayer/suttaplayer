Therīgāthā 5:12  CANDĀ, THE BEGGAR

Before, I had fallen on evil times:

no husband, no children,

no relatives, friends,

no way to obtain clothing & food.

So, taking a staff & bowl in hand,

begging for alms from house to house,

feverish from the cold & heat,

I wandered for seven full years.

Then seeing a nun

obtaining food & drink,

I approached her & said:

'Let me go forth

into homelessness.'

She, Paṭācārā, from sympathy,

let me go forth;

then, exhorting me,

urged me on to the highest goal.

Hearing her words,

I did her bidding.

Her exhortation was not in vain.

Endowed with the three knowledges,

I'm effluent-     free.
