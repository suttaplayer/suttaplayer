Therīgāthā 6:7  GUTTĀ

[The Buddha admonished me:]

Guttā, devote yourself to the goal

for which you went forth,

having discarded [hope]

for a dear son of your own.

Don't fall under the sway

of the mind.

Hoodwinked by mind,

beings in love with Māra's realm,

roam

through the many-birth wandering-on,

unknowing.

Abandoning these lower fetters, nun—

sensual desire, ill will,

self-identity views,

grasping at habits & practices,

and uncertainty as the fifth—

you won't come

to this again.

Forsaking     passion, conceit,

ignorance, & restlessness

—cutting through [all] the fetters—

you will make an end

of suffering & stress.

Discarding birth & wandering-on,

comprehending further becoming,

free from hunger

in the right-here-&-now

you will go about

totally calmed.
