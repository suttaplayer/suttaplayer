Therīgāthā 6:2  VĀSIṬṬHĪ THE MADWOMAN

Overwhelmed with grief for my son—

naked, demented,

my hair disheveled

my mind deranged—

I went about here & there,

living along the side of the road,

in cemeteries & heaps of trash,

for three full years,

afflicted with hunger & thirst.

Then I saw

the One Well-Gone,

gone to the city of Mithilā:

tamer of those untamed,

Self-Awakened,

with nothing to fear

from anything, anywhere.

Regaining my mind,

paying him homage,

I sat myself down.

He, Gotama, from sympathy

taught me the Dhamma.

Hearing his Dhamma,

I went forth into homelessness.

Applying myself to the Teacher's words,

I realized the state of auspicious bliss.

All griefs have been cut off,

abandoned,

brought to this end,

for I've comprehended

the grounds from which griefs

come into play.
