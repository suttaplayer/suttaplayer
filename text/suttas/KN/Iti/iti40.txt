ITIVUTTAKA 40

This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard: 'Monks, ignorance precedes the arrival of unskillful qualities; lack of shame & lack of compunction follow after. Clear knowing precedes the arrival of skillful qualities; shame & compunction follow after.'

Any bad destinations

in this world, in the next,

are rooted in ignorance–all–

accumulations

of desire & greed.

And when a person of evil desires

lacks shame & respect,

evil comes from that,

and by that he goes

to deprivation.

So cleansing away

ignorance, desire, & greed,

a monk giving rise to clear knowing

would abandon all bad destinations.
