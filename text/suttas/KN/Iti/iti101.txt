ITIVUTTAKA 101

This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard: 'Monks, these four things are next to nothing, both easy to gain & blameless. Which four? Cast-off cloth is next to nothing, both easy to gain & blameless. Alms food is next to nothing, both easy to gain & blameless. The root of a tree as a dwelling place is next to nothing, both easy to gain & blameless. Medicine made of smelly urine is next to nothing, both easy to gain & blameless. These are the four things that are next to nothing, both easy to gain & blameless. When a monk is content with what is next to nothing, easy to gain & blameless, then I say that he has one of the component factors of the contemplative life.'

Content with what's blameless,

next to nothing,

easy to gain,

his mind not vexed over

lodging, clothing,

food, or drink:

the four directions offer him

no                  obstruction.

These things, declared congenial

for the contemplative life,

are possessed by the monk

heedful, content.
