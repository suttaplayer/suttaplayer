ITIVUTTAKA 45

This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard: 'Monks, live enjoying aloofness, delighting in aloofness, inwardly committed to awareness-tranquility, not neglecting jhāna, endowed with clear-seeing insight, and frequenting empty buildings. As you live enjoying aloofness, delighting in aloofness, inwardly committed to awareness-tranquility, not neglecting jhāna, endowed with clear-seeing insight, and frequenting empty buildings, then one of two fruits can be expected: either gnosis right in the here-&-now, or–if there be any remnant of clinging-sustenance–non-return.'

Those with calm minds–

masterful,

mindful,

absorbed in jhāna–

clearly see Dhamma rightly,

not intent on sensual pleasures.

Delighting in heedfulness,

calm,

seeing danger in heedlessness, they

–incapable of falling away–

are right in the presence of Unbinding.
