ITIVUTTAKA 66

This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard: 'Monks, there are these three kinds of cleanliness. Which three? Bodily cleanliness, verbal cleanliness, mental cleanliness. These are the three kinds of cleanliness.'

Clean in body,

clean in speech,

clean in awareness

–effluent-free–

one who is clean,

consummate in cleanliness,

is said to have abandoned

the All.
