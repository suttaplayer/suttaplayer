ITIVUTTAKA 57

This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard: 'Monks, there are these three effluents. Which three? The effluent of sensuality, the effluent of becoming, the effluent of ignorance. These are the three effluents.'

His effluent of sensuality

ended,

his ignorance

faded away,

his effluent of becoming

exhausted:

one totally released, acquisition-free,

bears his last body,

having conquered MƒÅra

along with his mount.
