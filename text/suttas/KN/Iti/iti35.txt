ITIVUTTAKA 35

This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard: 'Monks, this holy life is lived, not for the sake of deceiving people, not for the sake of inveigling people, not for the sake of the rewards of gain, offerings, & tribute, nor with the thought, 'Thus may people know me.' This holy life is lived for the sake of restraint & abandoning.'

For the sake of restraint,

for the sake of abandoning,

he, the Blessed One, taught

a holy life not handed down,

coming ashore

in Unbinding.

This path is pursued

by those great in purpose,

great seers.

Those who follow it,

as taught by the One Awakened,

heeding the Teacher's message,

will put an end

to suffering & stress.
