ITIVUTTAKA 17

This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard: 'Monks, with regard to external factors, I don't envision any other single factor like friendship with admirable people as doing so much for a monk in training, who has not attained the heart's aspiration but remains intent on the unsurpassed safety from bondage. A monk who is a friend with admirable people abandons what is unskillful and develops what is skillful.'

A monk who's a friend

to admirable people

–who's reverential, respectful,

doing what his friends advise–

mindful, alert,

attains step by step

the ending of all fetters.
