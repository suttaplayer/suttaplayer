ITIVUTTAKA 32

This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard: 'Endowed with two things, monks, a person–as if carried off–is thus placed in hell. Which two? Evil habits & evil views. Endowed with these two things, a person–as if carried off–is thus placed in hell.'

Evil habits &

evil views:

a person, undiscerning,

endowed with these two things,

at the break-up of the body

reappears in hell.
