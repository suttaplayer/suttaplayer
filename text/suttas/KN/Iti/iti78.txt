ITIVUTTAKA 78

This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard: 'Monks, it's in accordance with their properties that beings come together & associate with one another. Beings of low dispositions come together & associate with beings of low dispositions. Beings of admirable dispositions come together & associate with beings of admirable dispositions. In the past, it was in accordance with their properties that beings came together & associated with one another.… In the future, it will be in accordance with their properties that beings will come together & associate with one another.… And now at present, it's in accordance with their properties that beings come together & associate with one another. Beings of low dispositions come together & associate with beings of low dispositions. Beings of admirable dispositions come together & associate with beings of admirable dispositions.'

The underbrush born

of association

is cut away

by non-association.

Just as one riding

a small wooden plank

would sink

in the great sea,

so does even one of right living

sink,

associating with the lazy.

So avoid the lazy,

those with low persistence.

Live with the noble ones–

secluded, resolute, absorbed in jhāna,

their persistence constantly aroused

: the wise.
