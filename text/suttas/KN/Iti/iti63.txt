ITIVUTTAKA 63

This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard: 'Monks, there are these three times. Which three? Past time, future time, present time. These are the three times.'

Perceiving in terms of signs, beings

take a stand on signs.

Not fully comprehending signs, they

come into the bonds

of death.

But fully comprehending signs, one

doesn't construe a signifier.

Touching liberation with the heart,

the state of peace unsurpassed,

consummate in terms of signs,

peaceful,

delighting in the peaceful state,

judicious,

an attainer-of-wisdom

makes use of classifications

but can't be classified.
