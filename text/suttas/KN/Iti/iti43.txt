ITIVUTTAKA 43

This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard: 'There is, monks, an unborn–unbecome–unmade–unfabricated. If there were not that unborn–unbecome–unmade–unfabricated, there would not be the case that escape from the born–become–made–fabricated would be discerned. But precisely because there is an unborn–unbecome–unmade–unfabricated, escape from the born–become–made–fabricated is thus discerned.'

The born, become, produced,

made, fabricated, impermanent,

fabricated of aging & death,

a nest of illnesses, perishing,

come-into-being through nourishment

and the guide [that is craving]–

is unfit for delight.

The escape from that

is

peaceful, permanent,

a sphere beyond conjecture,

unborn, unproduced,

the sorrowless, stainless state,

the cessation of stressful qualities,

stilling-of-fabrications bliss.
