ITIVUTTAKA 105

This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard: 'Monks, there are these four birthplaces of craving where a monk's craving, when taking birth, takes birth. Which four? Either for the sake of cloth a monk's craving, when taking birth, takes birth. Or for the sake of alms food a monk's craving, when taking birth, takes birth. Or for the sake of lodging a monk's craving, when taking birth, takes birth. Or for the sake of becoming or not becoming this or that a monk's craving, when taking birth, takes birth. These are the four birthplaces of craving where a monk's craving, when taking birth, takes birth.'

With craving his companion, a man

wanders on a long, long time.

Neither in this state here

nor anywhere else

does he go beyond

the wandering-   on.

Knowing this drawback–

that craving brings stress into play–

free         from craving,

devoid              of clinging,

mindful,                           the monk

lives the mendicant life.
