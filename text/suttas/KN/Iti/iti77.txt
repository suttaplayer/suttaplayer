ITIVUTTAKA 77

This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard: 'Monks, this body falls apart; consciousness is subject to fading; all acquisitions are inconstant, stressful, subject to change.'

Knowing the body as                  falling apart,

& consciousness            as dissolving away,

seeing the danger                  in acquisitions,

you've gone beyond

birth & death.

Having reached the foremost peace,

you bide your time,

composed.
