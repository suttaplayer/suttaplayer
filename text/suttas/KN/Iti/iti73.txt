ITIVUTTAKA 73

This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard: 'Monks, formless phenomena are more peaceful than forms; cessation, more peaceful than formless phenomena.'

Those beings headed to forms,

and those standing in the formless,

with no knowledge of cessation,

return to further becoming.

But, comprehending form,

not taking a stance in formless things,

those released in cessation

are people who've left death behind.

Having touched with his body

the deathless property free

from acquisitions,

having realized relinquishing

of acquisitions,

effluent-free,

the Rightly Self-awakened One

teaches the state

with

no sorrow,

no dust.
