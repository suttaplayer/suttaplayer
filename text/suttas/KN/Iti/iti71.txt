ITIVUTTAKA 71

This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard: 'Monks, I have seen beings who–endowed with bodily good conduct, verbal good conduct, & mental good conduct; who did not revile noble ones, who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views–at the break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in a good destination, a heavenly world. It's not from having heard this from another contemplative or brahman that I tell you that I have seen beings who–endowed with bodily good conduct, verbal good conduct, & mental good conduct; who did not revile noble ones, who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views–at the break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in a good destination, a heavenly world. It's from having known it myself, seen it myself, realized it myself that I tell you that I have seen beings who–endowed with bodily good conduct, verbal good conduct, & mental good conduct; who did not revile noble ones, who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views–at the break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in a good destination, a heavenly world.'

With mind rightly directed,

speaking right speech,

doing right deeds with the body:

a person here

of much learning,

a doer of merit

here in this next-to-nothing life,

at the break-up of the body,

discerning,

reappears in heaven.
