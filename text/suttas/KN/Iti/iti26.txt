ITIVUTTAKA 26

This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard: 'Monks, if beings knew, as I know, the results of giving & sharing, they would not eat without having given, nor would the stain of selfishness overcome their minds. Even if it were their last bite, their last mouthful, they would not eat without having shared, if there were someone to receive their gift. But because beings do not know, as I know, the results of giving & sharing, they eat without having given. The stain of selfishness overcomes their minds.'

If beings knew

what the Great Seer said,

how the result of sharing

has such great fruit,

then, subduing the stain of selfishness

with brightened awareness,

they'd give in season

to the noble ones,

where a gift bears great fruit.

Having given food

as an offering

to those worthy of offerings,

many donors,

when they pass away from here,

the human state,

go

to heaven.

They, having gone there

to heaven,

rejoice,

enjoying sensual pleasures.

Unselfish, they

partake of the result

of sharing.
