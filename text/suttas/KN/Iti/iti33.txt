ITIVUTTAKA 33

This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard: 'Endowed with two things, monks, a person–as if carried off–is thus placed in heaven. Which two? Auspicious habits & auspicious views. Endowed with these two things, a person–as if carried off–is thus placed in heaven.'

Auspicious habits &

auspicious views:

a person, discerning,

endowed with these two things,

at the break-up of the body

reappears in heaven.
