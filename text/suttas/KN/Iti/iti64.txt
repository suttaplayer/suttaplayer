ITIVUTTAKA 64

This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard: 'Monks, there are these three kinds of misconduct. Which three? Bodily misconduct, verbal misconduct, mental misconduct. These are the three kinds of misconduct.'

Having engaged

in bodily misconduct,

acts of verbal misconduct,

misconduct of mind,

or whatever else is flawed,

not having done what is skillful,

having done much that is not,

at the break-up of the body,

the undiscerning one reappears in

hell.
