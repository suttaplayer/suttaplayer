ITIVUTTAKA 69

This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard: 'Monks, anyone–monk or nun–in whom passion is unabandoned, aversion is unabandoned, & delusion is unabandoned, is said not to have crossed the ocean with its waves, breakers, & whirlpools, its seizers & demons. Anyone–monk or nun–in whom passion is abandoned, aversion is abandoned, & delusion is abandoned, is said to have crossed the ocean with its waves, breakers, & whirlpools, its seizers & demons. Having crossed over, having reached the far shore, he or she stands on high ground, a brahman.'

One whose passion, aversion, & ignorance

have faded away,

has crossed over this ocean

with its seizers,

demons,

dangerous waves,

so hard to cross.

Free from acquisitions

–bonds surmounted,

death abandoned–

he has abandoned stress

with no further becoming.

Having gone to the goal

he

is undefined,

has outwitted, I tell you,

the King of Death.
