ITIVUTTAKA 54

This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard: 'Monks, there are these three searches. Which three? The search for sensuality, the search for becoming, the search for a holy life. These are the three searches.'

Centered,

alert,

mindful,

the Awakened One's

disciple

discerns searches,

how searches come into play,

where they cease,

& the path to their ending.

With the ending of searches, a monk

free from hunger

is totally unbound.
