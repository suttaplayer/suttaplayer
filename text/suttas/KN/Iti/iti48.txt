ITIVUTTAKA 48

This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard: 'Monks, these two are doomed to deprivation, to hell, for not abandoning their conduct. Which two? One who, not living the celibate life, pretends to be one who lives the celibate life; and one who groundlessly accuses one who lives the celibate life perfectly & purely of uncelibate behavior. These are the two who are doomed to deprivation, to hell, for not abandoning their conduct.'

He goes to hell,

the one who asserts

what didn't take place,

as does the one

who, having done,

says, 'I didn't.'

Both–low-acting people–

there become equal:

after death, in the world beyond.

An ochre robe tied 'round their necks,

many with evil qualities

–unrestrained, evil–

rearise, because of their evil acts,

in hell.

Better to eat an iron ball

–glowing, aflame–

than that, unprincipled &

unrestrained,

you should eat the alms of the country.
