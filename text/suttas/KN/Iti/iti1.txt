ITIVUTTAKA 1

This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard: 'Abandon one quality, monks, and I guarantee you non-return. Which one quality? Abandon greed as the one quality, and I guarantee you non-return.' This is the meaning of what the Blessed One said. So with regard to this it was said:

The greed with which

beings go to a bad destination,

coveting:

from rightly knowing that greed,

those who see clearly

let go.

Letting go,

they never come to this world

again.

This, too, was the meaning of what was said by the Blessed One, so I have heard.
