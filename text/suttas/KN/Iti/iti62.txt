ITIVUTTAKA 62

This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard: 'Monks, there are these three faculties. Which three? The faculty of 'I am about to know what is not yet finally known,' the faculty of final knowledge, the faculty of one who has finally known. These are the three faculties.'

For a learner in training

along the straight path:

first, the knowledge of ending;

then, immediately,

gnosis;

then, from the ending

of the fetter–becoming–

there's the knowledge,

the gnosis of         one released

who is Such:

'My release is unprovoked.'

One consummate in these faculties,

peaceful,

delighting in the peaceful state,

bears his last body,

having conquered Māra

along with his mount.
