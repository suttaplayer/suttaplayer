ITIVUTTAKA 7

This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard: 'Monks, one who has not fully known & fully understood the All, whose mind has not been cleansed of passion for it, has not abandoned it, is incapable of putting an end to stress. But one who has fully known & fully understood the All, whose mind has been cleansed of passion for it and has abandoned it, is capable of putting an end to stress.'

Knowing the All

from all around,

not stirred by passion

in all places:

he, having comprehended

the All,

has gone beyond

all stress.
