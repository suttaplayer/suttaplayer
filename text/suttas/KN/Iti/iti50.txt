ITIVUTTAKA 50

This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard: 'Monks, there are these three roots of what is unskillful. Which three? Greed as a root of what is unskillful, aversion as a root of what is unskillful, delusion as a root of what is unskillful. These are the three roots of what is unskillful.'

Greed, aversion, delusion destroy

the self-same person of evil mind

from whom they are born,

like the fruiting

of the bamboo.
