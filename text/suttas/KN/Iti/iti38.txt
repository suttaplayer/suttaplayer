ITIVUTTAKA 38

This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard: 'Monks, two trains of thought often occur to the Tathāgata, worthy & rightly self-awakened: the thought of safety & that of seclusion.

'The Tathāgata enjoys non-ill will, delights in non-ill will. To him–enjoying non-ill will, delighting in non-ill will–this thought often occurs: 'By this activity I harm no one at all, whether weak or firm.'

'The Tathāgata enjoys seclusion, delights in seclusion. To him–enjoying seclusion, delighting in seclusion–this thought often occurs: 'Whatever is unskillful is abandoned.'

'Thus, monks, you too should live enjoying non-ill will, delighting in non-ill will. To you–enjoying non-ill will, delighting in non-ill will–this thought will often occur: 'By this activity we harm no one at all, whether weak or firm.'

'You too should live enjoying seclusion, delighting in seclusion. To you–enjoying seclusion, delighting in seclusion–this thought will often occur: 'What is unskillful? What is not yet abandoned? What are we abandoning?'

To the Tathāgata,

awakened,

who endured what is hard to endure,

two thoughts occur:

safety

the first thought mentioned;

seclusion

the second declared.

The dispeller of darkness, free

of effluent,

the great seer

who has

gone beyond,

reached attainment,

gained mastery,

crossed over the poisons;

who's released in the ending of craving:

that sage

bears his last body,

has shaken off Māra, I tell you,

has gone      beyond aging.

As one standing on a rocky crag

would see the people all around below,

so the wise one,

with the all-around eye,

having scaled the tower

made of Dhamma,

having crossed over sorrow,

gazes on those overwhelmed with sorrow,

conquered by aging & death.
