ITIVUTTAKA 37

This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard: 'Endowed with two things, monks, a monk lives full of ease in the here-&-now and is appropriately aroused for the ending of the effluents. Which two? A sense of urgency toward things that should inspire urgency and, feeling urgency, appropriate exertion. Endowed with these two things, a monk lives full of ease in the here-&-now and is appropriately aroused for the ending of the effluents.'

Feeling urgency right here

toward what should inspire urgency,

the wise,

masterful,

ardent monk

should investigate

with discernment.

One who lives thus ardently,

not restlessly, at peace,

committed to awareness-tranquility,

would attain the ending

of suffering & stress.
