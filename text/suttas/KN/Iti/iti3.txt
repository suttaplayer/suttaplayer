ITIVUTTAKA 3

This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard: 'Abandon one quality, monks, and I guarantee you non-return. Which one quality? Abandon delusion as the one quality, and I guarantee you non-return.'

The delusion with which

beings go to a bad destination,

confused:

from rightly knowing that delusion,

those who see clearly

let go.

Letting go,

they never come to this world

again.
