ITIVUTTAKA 60

This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard: 'Monks, there are these three grounds for meritorious activity. Which three? The ground for meritorious activity made of generosity, the ground for meritorious activity made of virtue, and the ground for meritorious activity made of development [meditation]. These are the three grounds for meritorious activity.'

Train in acts of merit

that yield the foremost profit of blissâ€“

develop generosity,

a life in tune,

a mind of good will.

Developing these

three things

that bring about bliss,

the wise reappear

in a world of bliss

unalloyed.
