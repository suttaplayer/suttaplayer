ITIVUTTAKA 72

This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard: 'Monks, there are these three properties for escape. Which three? This is the escape from sensuality: renunciation. This is the escape from form: formlessness. And as for whatever has come into being, is fabricated & dependently co-arisen, the escape from that is cessation. These are the three properties for escape.'

Knowing the escape from sensuality,

& the overcoming of forms

–ardent

always–

touching the stilling

of all fabrications:

he is a monk

who's seen rightly.

From that he is there released.

A master of direct knowing,

at peace,

he is a sage

gone beyond bonds.
