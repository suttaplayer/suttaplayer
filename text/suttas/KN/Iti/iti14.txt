ITIVUTTAKA 14

This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard: 'Monks, I don't envision even one other hindrance–hindered by which people go wandering & transmigrating on for a long, long time–like the hindrance of ignorance. Hindered by the hindrance of ignorance, people go wandering & transmigrating on for a long, long time.'

No one other thing

so hinders people

that they wander on, day & night,

as when they're obstructed

by delusion.

But those who, letting go of delusion,

shatter the mass of darkness,

wander               no further.

Their cause isn't found.
