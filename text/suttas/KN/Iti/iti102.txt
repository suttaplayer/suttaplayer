ITIVUTTAKA 102

This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard: 'Monks, for one knowing & seeing, I tell you, there is the ending of effluents, not for one not knowing & seeing. For one knowing what & seeing what is there the ending of effluents? For one knowing & seeing, 'This is stress,' there is the ending of effluents. For one knowing & seeing, 'This is the origination of stress,' there is the ending of effluents. For one knowing & seeing, 'This is the cessation of stress,' there is the ending of effluents. For one knowing & seeing, 'This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress,' there is the ending of effluents. For one knowing in this way and seeing in this way is there the ending of effluents.'

For a learner in training

along the straight path, there arises:

first,               the knowledge of ending;

then,               the gnosis unsurpassed;

then,               the gnosis of one released–

release-knowledge, superlative,

the knowledge of ending:

'The fetters are ended.'

Certainly not by the lazy fool

uncomprehending,

is there attained

Unbinding,

the loosening of all ties.
