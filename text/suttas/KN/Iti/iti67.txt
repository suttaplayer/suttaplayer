ITIVUTTAKA 67

This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard: 'Monks, there are these three forms of sagacity. Which three? Bodily sagacity, verbal sagacity, mental sagacity. These are the three forms of sagacity.'

A sage in body, a sage in speech,

a sage in mind, effluent-free:

a sage consummate         in sagacity

is said to be bathed                     of evil.
