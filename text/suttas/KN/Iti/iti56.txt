ITIVUTTAKA 56

This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard: 'Monks, there are these three effluents. Which three? The effluent of sensuality, the effluent of becoming, the effluent of ignorance. These are the three effluents.'

Centered,

alert,

mindful,

the Awakened One's

disciple

discerns effluents,

how effluents come into play,

where they cease,

& the path to their ending.

With the ending of effluents, a monk

free from hunger

is totally unbound.
