OLD AGE
JARĀ SUTTA  Saṁyutta Nikāya 1:51

'What is good      all the way through old age?

What is good      when established?

What is the treasure of human beings?

What can't be stolen by thieves?'

The Buddha:

'Virtue is good      all the way through old age.

Conviction is good      when established.

Discernment is the treasure of human beings.

Merit can't be stolen by thieves.'
