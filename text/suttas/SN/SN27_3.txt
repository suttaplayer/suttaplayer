CONSCIOUSNESS
VIÑÑĀṆA SUTTA  Saṁyutta Nikāya 27:3

Near Sāvatthī. 'Monks, any desire-passion with regard to eye-consciousness is a defilement of the mind. Any desire-passion with regard to ear-consciousness… nose-consciousness… tongue-consciousness… body-consciousness… intellect-consciousness is a defilement of the mind. When, with regard to these six bases, the defilements of awareness are abandoned, then the mind is inclined to renunciation. The mind fostered by renunciation feels malleable for the direct knowing of those qualities worth realizing.'
