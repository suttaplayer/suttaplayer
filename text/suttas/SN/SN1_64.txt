FETTERED
SAÑÑOJANA SUTTA  Saṁyutta Nikāya 1:64

'With what         is the world fettered?

What         is its exploration?

With the abandoning

of what

is there said,

'unbinding'?'

The Buddha:

'Fettered with delight         is the world.

Directed thought         is its exploration.

With the abandoning

of craving

is there said,

'unbinding.'
