ENGENDERED
JANA SUTTA  Saṁyutta Nikāya 1:55

'What engenders a person?

What does one have that runs around?

What rushes toward the wandering-on?

What does one have

as one's great danger?'

The Buddha:

'Craving         engenders a person.

One's mind         is what runs around.

A being         rushes toward the wandering-on.

Suffering            is one's great danger.'
