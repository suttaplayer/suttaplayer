UGLY
DUBBAṆṆIYA SUTTA  Saṁyutta Nikāya 11:22

Near Sāvatthī. 'Once, monks, a certain yakkha—ugly & misshapen—sat down on Sakka the deva-king's seat. Then the devas of the Thirty-three were indignant, annoyed, & complained: 'Isn't it amazing, good sirs! Isn't it astounding! This yakkha—ugly & misshapen—has sat down on Sakka's seat!' But the more the devas of the Thirty-three were indignant, annoyed, & complained, the more well-formed that yakkha became, the more good-looking & inspiring.

'Then the devas of the Thirty-three went to Sakka the deva-king and, on arrival, said to him, 'Just now, dear sir, a certain yakkha—ugly & misshapen—sat down on your seat. The devas of the Thirty-three were indignant, annoyed, & complained: 'Isn't it amazing, good sirs! Isn't it astounding! This yakkha—ugly & misshapen—has sat down on Sakka's seat!' But the more the devas of the Thirty-three were indignant, annoyed, & complained, the more well-formed that yakkha became, the more good-looking & inspiring.'

'Then, dear sirs, he must be an anger-eating yakkha.'

'So Sakka the deva-king approached the anger-eating yakkha and, on arrival, arranging his upper robe over one shoulder & kneeling with one knee on the ground, raised his hands palm-to-palm over his heart toward the anger-eating yakkha and announced his name three times, 'I, dear sir, am Sakka the deva-king! I, dear sir, am Sakka the deva-king! I, dear sir, am Sakka the deva-king!' The more Sakka the deva-king announced his name, the uglier & more misshapen the yakkha became. Then, having become uglier & more misshapen, he disappeared right there.

'Then Sakka the deva-king, sitting down on his seat & conciliating the devas of the Thirthy-three, on that occasion recited these verses:

'I'm not easily upset in mind,

nor easily led into a whirl.

I don't get angry for long.

Anger doesn't persist in me.

When angry, I don't speak harshly

or insist on my virtues.

I keep myself well under control

with an eye to my own good.'
