WITH MAṆIBHADDA
MAṆIBHADDA SUTTA  Saṁyutta Nikāya 10:4

On one occasion the Blessed One was staying among the Magadhans at the Jewel-stand Shrine, the haunt of the yakkha-spirit, Maṇibhadda [Auspicious Jewel].

Then Maṇibhadda the yakkha-spirit went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, recited this verse:

'It's always auspicious for one who is mindful.

The mindful one prospers happily—always.

The mindful one grows better each day

and is totally freed from animosity.'

The Buddha:

'It's always auspicious for one who is mindful.

The mindful one prospers happily always.

The mindful one grows better each day

but isn't totally freed from animosity.

Whoever's heart, all day, all night,

delights in harmlessness

with goodwill for all beings

has no animosity         with anyone at all.
