NEGLECTED
VIRADDHA SUTTA  Saṁyutta Nikāya 47:33

'Monks, those in whom the four establishings of mindfulness are neglected, in them the noble eightfold path leading to the right ending of suffering & stress is neglected. Those in whom the four establishings of mindfulness are aroused, in them the noble eightfold path leading to the right ending of suffering & stress is aroused.

'Which four? There is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in & of itself—ardent, alert, & mindful—subduing greed & distress with reference to the world. He remains focused on feelings in & of themselves… mind in & of itself… mental qualities in & of themselves—ardent, alert, & mindful—subduing greed & distress with reference to the world.

'Those in whom these four establishings of mindfulness are neglected, in them the noble eigthfold path leading to the right ending of suffering & stress is neglected. Those in whom these four establishings of mindfulness are aroused, in them the noble eightfold path leading to the right ending of suffering & stress is aroused.'
