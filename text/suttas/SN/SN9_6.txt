ANURUDDHA
ANURUDDHA SUTTA  Saṁyutta Nikāya 9:6

I have heard that on one occasion Venerable Anuruddha was staying among the Kosalans in a forest grove. Now at that time, a devatā from the retinue of the heaven of the Thirty-three named Jālinī, one of Venerable Anuruddha's former consorts, went to him and, on arrival, addressed him with this verse:

'Direct your mind

to where you used to live,

among the Devas of the Thirty-three,

empowered

with all sensual pleasures.

Honored, surrounded

by deva maidens,

you

will shine.'

Venerable Anuruddha:

'They've gone astray,

deva maidens

established in self-identity.

And they've gone astray,

those beings with deva maidens

as their aim.'

Jālinī:

'They don't know bliss

who haven't seen Nandana,

abode of the eminent devas,

glorious,

of the Thirty-three.'

Venerable Anuruddha:

'You fool, don't you know

the arahants' maxim?—

'How inconstant are fabrications!

Their nature:      to arise & pass away.

They disband      as they are arising.

Their total stilling         is bliss.'

Jālinī, there is now

in deva company

no further abode

(for me).

With the utter ending

of wandering on in birth,

there is now

no further becoming.'
