NEGLECTED
VIRADDHA SUTTA  Saṁyutta Nikāya 46:18

'Monks, those in whom the seven factors for awakening are neglected, in them the noble path leading to the right ending of suffering & stress is neglected. Those in whom the seven factors for awakening are aroused, in them the noble path leading to the right ending of suffering & stress is aroused.

'Which seven? Mindfulness as a factor for awakening, analysis of qualities as a factor for awakening, persistence as a factor for awakening, rapture as a factor for awakening, calm as a factor for awakening, concentration as a factor for awakening, & equanimity as a factor for awakening. These are the seven factors for awakening.

'Those in whom these seven factors for awakening are neglected, in them the noble path leading to the right ending of suffering & stress is neglected. Those in whom these seven factors for awakening are aroused, in them the noble path leading to the right ending of suffering & stress is aroused.'
