THE BURDEN
BHĀRA SUTTA  Saṁyutta Nikāya 22:22

Near Sāvatthī. 'Monks, I will teach you the burden, the carrier of the burden, the taking up of the burden, and the casting off of the burden. Listen & pay close attention. I will speak.'

'As you say, lord,' the monks responded to him.

The Blessed One said, 'And which is the burden? 'The five clinging-aggregates,' it should be said. Which five? The form clinging-aggregate, the feeling clinging-aggregate, the perception clinging-aggregate, the fabrications clinging-aggregate, the consciousness clinging-aggregate: This, monks, is called the burden.

'And which is the carrier of the burden? 'The person,' it should be said. This venerable one with such a name, such a clan-name: This is called the carrier of the burden.

'And which is the taking up of the burden? The craving that makes for further becoming—accompanied by passion & delight, relishing now here & now there—i e, craving for sensuality, craving for becoming, craving for non-becoming: This is called the taking up of the burden.

'And which is the casting off of the burden? The remainderless fading & cessation, renunciation, relinquishment, release, & letting go of that very craving: This is called the casting off of the burden.'

That is what the Blessed One said. Having said that, the One Well-Gone, the Teacher, said further:

A burden indeed

are the five aggregates,

and the carrier of the burden

is the person.

Taking up the burden in the world

is stressful.

Casting off the burden

is bliss.

Having cast off the heavy burden

and not taking on another,

pulling up craving,

along with its root,

one is free from hunger,

totally unbound.
