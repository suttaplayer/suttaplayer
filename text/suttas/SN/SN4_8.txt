DELIGHT
NANDANA SUTTA  Saṁyutta Nikāya 4:8

I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery. Then Māra the Evil One went to the Blessed One and recited this verse in his presence:

'Those with children

delight

because of their children.

Those with cattle

delight

because of their cows.

A person's delight

comes from acquisitions,

since a person with no acquisitions

doesn't delight.'

The Buddha:

'Those with children

grieve

because of their children.

Those with cattle

grieve

because of their cows.

A person's grief

comes from acquisitions,

since a person with no acquisitions

doesn't grieve.'

Then Māra the Evil One—sad & dejected at realizing, 'The Blessed One knows me; the One Well-Gone knows me'—vanished right there.
