DEATHLESS
AMATA SUTTA  Saṁyutta Nikāya 47:41

At Savatthi. 'Monks, remain with your minds well-established in the four establishings of mindfulness. Don't let the deathless be lost for you.

'In which four? There is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in & of itself—ardent, alert, & mindful—subduing greed & distress with reference to the world. He remains focused on feelings… mind… mental qualities in & of themselves—ardent, alert, & mindful—subduing greed & distress with reference to the world.

'Monks, remain with your minds well-established in these four establishings of mindfulness. Don't let the deathless be lost for you.'
