ENDING
KHAYA SUTTA  Saṁyutta Nikāya 46:26

'Monks, develop the path & practice leading to the ending of craving. And which is the path, which is the practice, leading to the ending of craving? The seven factors for awakening: mindfulness as a factor for awakening, analysis of qualities as a factor for awakening, persistence as a factor for awakening, rapture as a factor for awakening, calm as a factor for awakening, concentration as a factor for awakening, & equanimity as a factor for awakening.

'When this was said, Venerable Udāyin said to the Blessed One, 'How are the seven factors for awakening developed, how are they pursued, so as to lead to the ending of craving?'

'There is the case, Udāyin, where a monk develops mindfulness as a factor for awakening dependent on seclusion, dependent on dispassion, dependent on cessation, abundant, enlarged, immeasurable, without ill will. In him—as mindfulness as a factor for awakening is developed dependent on seclusion, dependent on dispassion, dependent on cessation, abundant, enlarged, immeasurable, without ill will—craving is abandoned.

[Similarly with the remaining factors for awakening.]

'From the abandoning of craving, action [kamma] is abandoned. From the abandoning of action, stress is abandoned.

'Thus, Udāyin, from the ending of craving comes the ending of action; from the ending of action, the ending of stress.'
