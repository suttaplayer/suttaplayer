THE OCEAN (1)
SAMUDDA SUTTA  Saṁyutta Nikāya 35:187

'The ocean, the ocean,' says the uninstructed run-of-the-mill person. But that's not the ocean in the discipline of the noble ones. It's a great mass of water, a great body of water.

'The eye is a person's ocean, and its current consists of forms. Whoever resists that current consisting of forms is said to have crossed over the ocean of the eye with its waves, whirlpools, sharks, & demons. Crossed over, gone beyond, one stands on high ground, a brahman.

'The ear is a person's ocean…

'The nose is a person's ocean…

'The tongue is a person's ocean…

'The body is a person's ocean…

'The intellect is a person's ocean, and its current consists of ideas. Whoever resists that current consisting of ideas is said to have crossed over the ocean of the intellect with its waves, whirlpools, sharks, & demons. Crossed over, gone beyond, one stands on firm ground, a brahman.'

That is what the Blessed One said. When the One Well-gone had said that, he—the Teacher—said further:

Whoever crosses over this ocean,

with its danger of sharks, demons, waves,

so very hard to cross

is called:

an attainer of wisdom

who has lived the holy life,

one who's attained the end of the cosmos,

one gone beyond.
