ALMS
PIṆḌA SUTTA  Saṁyutta Nikāya 4:18

On one occasion the Blessed One was staying among the Magadhans near the brahman village of Pañcasālā. And on that occasion there were young people's presents (being given) in Pañcasālā. Then early in the morning, the Blessed One, having adjusted his under robe and carrying his bowl & outer robe, went into Pañcasālā for alms. And at that time Māra, the Evil One, had taken possession of the brahman householders of Pañcasālā [with the thought,] 'Don't let Gotama the contemplative get alms.' Then the Blessed One left Pañcasālā with his bowl as clean as it had been when he entered.

Then Māra the Evil One went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, said to him, 'Did you get any alms, contemplative?'

'So was it you, Evil One, who arranged that I didn't get alms?'

'In that case, lord, let the Blessed One go into Pañcasālā a second time. I'll arrange that you get alms.'

The Buddha:

'You've produced demerit, Evil One,

insulting the Tathāgata.

How very happily we live,

we who have nothing.

We will feed on rapture

like the Radiant devas.'

Then Māra the Evil One—sad & dejected at realizing, 'The Blessed One knows me; the One Well-gone knows me'—vanished right there.
