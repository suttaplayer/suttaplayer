SĀRIPUTTA SUTTA  Saṁyutta Nikāya 55:5

Then Venerable Sāriputta went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there, the Blessed One said to him, 'A factor for stream entry, a factor for stream entry': This it is said. And what, Sāriputta, is a factor for stream entry?'

'Association with people of integrity, lord, is a factor for stream entry. Listening to the True Dhamma is a factor for stream entry. Appropriate attention is a factor for stream entry. Practice in accordance with the Dhamma is a factor for stream entry.'

'Excellent, Sariputta! Excellent! Association with people of integrity is a factor for stream entry. Listening to the True Dhamma is a factor for stream entry. Appropriate attention is a factor for stream entry. Practice in accordance with the Dhamma is a factor for stream entry.

'Sāriputta, 'The stream, the stream': Thus it is said. And what, Sāriputta, is the stream?'

'This noble eightfold path, lord, is the stream: right view, right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration.'

'Excellent, Sariputta! Excellent! This noble eightfold path—right view, right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration—is the stream.

'Sāriputta, 'A streamwinner, a streamwinner': Thus it is said. And what, Sāriputta, is a streamwinner?'

'Anyone endowed with this noble eightfold path, lord, is a streamwinner.'

'Excellent, Sariputta! Excellent! Anyone endowed with this noble eightfold path is a streamwinner.'
