INAPPROPRIATE ATTENTION
AYONISO-MANASIKĀRA SUTTA  Saṁyutta Nikāya 9:11

I have heard that on one occasion a certain monk was staying among the Kosalans in a forest grove. Now at that time, he spent the day's abiding thinking evil, unskillful thoughts: i e, thoughts of sensuality, thoughts of ill will, thoughts of doing harm.

Then the devatā inhabiting the forest grove, feeling sympathy for the monk, desiring his benefit, desiring to bring him to his senses, approached him and addressed him with this verse:

'From inappropriate attention

you're being chewed by your thoughts.

Relinquishing what's inappropriate,

contemplate

appropriately.

Keeping your mind on the Teacher,

the Dhamma, the Saṅgha, your virtues,

you will arrive at

joy,

rapture,

pleasure

without doubt.

Then,                  saturated

with joy,

you will put an end

to suffering & stress.'

The monk, chastened by the devatā, came to his senses.
