VATTHA SUTTA  Saṁyutta Nikāya 46:4

On one occasion Venerable Sāriputta was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery. There he addressed the monks, 'Friend monks!'

'Yes, friend,' the monks responded to him.

Venerable Sāriputta said, 'Friends, there are these seven factors for awakening. Which seven? Mindfulness as a factor for awakening, analysis of qualities as a factor for awakening, persistence as a factor for awakening, rapture as a factor for awakening, calm as a factor for awakening, concentration as a factor for awakening, & equanimity as a factor for awakening. These are the seven factors for awakening.

'Whichever factor for awakening among these seven factors for awakening I want to dwell in during the morning, I dwell in that factor for awakening during the morning. Whichever factor for awakening I want to dwell in during the middle of the day, I dwell in that factor for awakening during the middle of the day. Whichever factor for awakening I want to dwell in during the late afternoon, I dwell in that factor for awakening during the late afternoon.

'If the thought occurs to me, 'mindfulness as a factor for awakening,' the thought occurs to me, 'It is immeasurable'; the thought occurs to me, 'It is well-mastered.' While it remains, I discern, 'It remains.' If it falls away from me, I discern, 'It has fallen away from me because of this condition.'

[Similarly with analysis of qualities as a factor for awakening, persistence as a factor for awakening, rapture as a factor for awakening, calm as a factor for awakening, and concentration as a factor for awakening.]

'If the thought occurs to me, 'equanimity as a factor for awakening,' the thought occurs to me, 'It is immeasurable'; the thought occurs to me, 'It is well-mastered.' While it remains, I discern, 'It remains.' If it falls away from me, I discern, 'It has fallen away from me because of this condition.'

'Suppose, friends, that a king or king's minister had a wardrobe full of many-colored clothes. Whichever set of clothes he might want to wear during the morning, he would wear that set of clothes during the morning. Whichever set of clothes he might want to wear during the middle of the day, he would wear that set of clothes during the middle of the day. Whichever set of clothes he might want to wear during the late afternoon, he would wear that set of clothes during the late afternoon.

'In the same way, whichever factor for awakening among these seven factors for awakening I want to dwell in during the morning, I dwell in that factor for awakening during the morning. Whichever factor for awakening I want to dwell in during the middle of the day, I dwell in that factor for awakening during the middle of the day. Whichever factor for awakening I want to dwell in during the late afternoon, I dwell in that factor for awakening during the late afternoon.

'If the thought occurs to me, 'mindfulness as a factor for awakening,' the thought occurs to me, 'It is immeasurable'; the thought occurs to me, 'It is well-mastered.' While it remains, I discern, 'It remains.' If it falls away from me, I discern, 'It has fallen away from me because of this condition.'

[Similarly with analysis of qualities as a factor for awakening, persistence as a factor for awakening, rapture as a factor for awakening, calm as a factor for awakening, and concentration as a factor for awakening.]

'If the thought occurs to me, 'equanimity as a factor for awakening,' the thought occurs to me, 'It is immeasurable'; the thought occurs to me, 'It is well-mastered.' While it remains, I discern, 'It remains.' If it falls away from me, I discern, 'It has fallen away from me because of this condition.'
