INTENTION
CETANĀ SUTTA  Saṁyutta Nikāya 27:7

Near Sāvatthī. 'Monks, any desire-passion with regard to intentions involving forms is a defilement of the mind. Any desire-passion with regard to intentions involving sounds… intentions involving aromas… intentions involving flavors… intentions involving tactile sensations… intentions involving ideas is a defilement of the mind. When, with regard to these six bases, the defilements of awareness are abandoned, then the mind is inclined to renunciation. The mind fostered by renunciation feels malleable for the direct knowing of those qualities worth realizing.'
