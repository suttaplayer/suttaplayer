PAÑCĀLACAṆḌA THE DEVA'S SON
PAÑCĀLACAṆḌA SUTTA  Saṁyutta Nikāya 2:7

Near Sāvatthī. As he was standing to one side, Pañcālacaṇḍa the deva's son recited this verse in the Blessed One's presence:

'Truly in a confining place, he found an opening—

the one of extensive wisdom,

the awakened one who awakened to jhāna,

the chief bull, withdrawn,

the sage.'

The Buddha:

'Even in a confining place they find it,

[Pañcālacaṇḍa,' said the Blessed One,]

'the Dhamma for the attainment of unbinding.

Those who have gained mindfulness

are rightly well-centered.'
