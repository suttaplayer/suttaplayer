SUBRAHMA THE DEVA'S SON
SUBRAHMA SUTTA  Saṁyutta Nikāya 2:17

Standing to one side, Subrahma the deva's son recited this verse to the Blessed One:

'Constantly troubled is this mind,

constantly trembling this heart,

over duties that have yet to arise,

and those already arisen.

If there is an Untroubled,

point it out to me, when asked.'

The Buddha:

'Apart from the factors for awakening, austerity,

apart from sense-faculty restraint,

apart from relinquishing the all,

I see no safety

for living beings.'

That is what the Blessed One said… the deva disappeared right there.
