ENGENDERED (3)
JANA SUTTA  Saṁyutta Nikāya 1:57

'What engenders a person?

What does one have that runs around?

What rushes toward the wandering-on?

What does one have

as one's support?'

The Buddha:

'Craving           engenders a person.

One's mind           is what runs around.

A being           rushes toward the wandering-on.

Action           is one's support.'
