TO A MONK
BHIKKHU SUTTA  Saṁyutta Nikāya 46:5

Then a certain monk approached the Blessed One and, on arrival, bowed down to him and sat to one side. As he was sitting there, he said to the Blessed One, 'Lord, 'factors for awakening, factors for awakening,' it is said. To what extent are they said to be factors for awakening?'

'They lead to awakening, monk. Therefore they are said to be factors for awakening.

'There is the case where a monk develops mindfulness as a factor for awakening dependent on seclusion, dependent on dispassion, dependent on cessation, resulting in letting go. He develops analysis of qualities as a factor for awakening… persistence as a factor for awakening… rapture as a factor for awakening… calm as a factor for awakening… concentration as a factor for awakening… equanimity as a factor for awakening dependent on seclusion, dependent on dispassion, dependent on cessation, resulting in letting go.

'When these factors for awakening are developed, the mind is released from the effluent of sensuality, the mind is released from the effluent of becoming, the mind is released from the effluent of ignorance. With release, there is the knowledge, 'Released.' One discerns that 'Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for the sake of this world.'

'They lead to awakening, monk. Therefore they are said to be factors for awakening.'
