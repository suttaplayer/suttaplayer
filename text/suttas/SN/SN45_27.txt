A POT
KUMBHA SUTTA  Saṁyutta Nikāya 45:27

At Sāvatthī. 'Monks, just as a pot without a stand is easy to knock over, but if it has a stand is hard to knock over; in the same way, the mind without a stand is easy to knock over, but if it has a stand is hard to knock over.

'And what is the mind's stand? Just this noble eightfold path, i e, right view, right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, & right concentration.

'Just as a pot without a stand is easy to knock over, but if it has a stand is hard to knock over; in the same way, the mind without a stand is easy to knock over, but if it has a stand is hard to knock over.'
