REAL
TATHA SUTTA  Saṁyutta Nikāya 56:20

'Monks, these four things are real, not unreal, without alteration. Which four?

'This is stress,' is real, not unreal, without alteration. 'This is the origination of stress,' is real, not unreal, without alteration. 'This is the cessation of stress,' is real, not unreal, without alteration. 'This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress,' is real, not unreal, without alteration.

'These are the four things that are real, not unreal, without alteration.

'Therefore your duty is the contemplation, 'This is stress … This is the origination of stress … This is the cessation of stress.' Your duty is the contemplation, 'This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress.'
