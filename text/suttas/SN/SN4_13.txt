THE STONE SLIVER
SAKALIKA SUTTA  Saṁyutta Nikāya 4:13

I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rājagaha in the Maddakucchi Deer Reserve. Now at that time his foot had been pierced by a stone sliver. Excruciating were the bodily feelings that developed within him—painful, fierce, sharp, wracking, repellent, disagreeable—but he endured them mindful, alert, & unperturbed. Having had his outer robe folded in four and laid out, he lay down on his right side in the lion's posture—with one foot placed on top of the other—mindful & alert.

Then Māra the Evil One went to the Blessed One and recited this verse in his presence:

'Are you lying there in a stupor,

or drunk on poetry?

Are your goals so very few?

All alone in a secluded lodging,

what is this dreamer, this sleepy-face?'

The Buddha:

'I lie here,

not in a stupor,

nor drunk on poetry.

My goal attained,

I am sorrow-free.

All alone in a secluded lodging,

I lie down with sympathy

for all beings.

Even those pierced in the chest

with an arrow,

their hearts rapidly,

rapidly

beating:

even they with their arrows

are able to sleep.

So why shouldn't I,

with my arrow         removed?

I'm not awake with worry,

nor afraid to sleep.

Days & nights

don't oppress me.

I see no threat of decline

in any world at all.

That's why I sleep

with sympathy

for all beings.'

Then Māra the Evil One—sad & dejected at realizing, 'The Blessed One knows me; the One Well-Gone knows me'—vanished right there.
