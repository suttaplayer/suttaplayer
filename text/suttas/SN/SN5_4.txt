SISTER VIJAYĀ
VIJAYĀ SUTTA  Saṁyutta Nikāya 5:4

Near Sāvatthī. Then, early in the morning, Vijayā the nun adjusted her robes and, taking her bowl & outer robe, went into Sāvatthī for alms. When she had gone for alms in Sāvatthī and had returned from her alms round, after her meal she went to the Grove of the Blind to spend the day. Having gone deep into the Grove of the Blind, she sat down at the foot of a tree for the day's abiding.

Then Māra the Evil One, wanting to arouse fear, horripilation, & terror in her, wanting to make her fall away from concentration, approached her & addressed her in verse:

'You, a beautiful young woman.

I, a young man.

Come, my lady,

let's enjoy ourselves

to the music of a five-piece band.'

Then the thought occurred to Vijayā the nun: 'Now who has recited this verse—a human being or a non-human one?' Then it occurred to her: 'This is Māra the Evil One who has recited this verse wanting to arouse fear, horripilation, & terror in me, wanting to make me fall away from concentration.'

Then, having understood that 'This is Māra the Evil One,' she replied to him in verses:

'Lovely sights, sounds,

smells, tastes,

& tactile sensations

I leave to

you, Māra.

I

have no need

for them.

I'm disgusted, ashamed

of this putrid body—

disintegrating, dissolving.

Sensual craving

is rooted out.

Beings who have come to form,

& those with a share in the formless,

& the peaceful attainments:

their darkness

is completely destroyed.'

Then Māra the Evil One—sad & dejected at realizing, 'Vijayā the nun knows me'—vanished right there.
