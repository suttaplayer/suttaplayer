ENGENDERED (2)
JANA SUTTA  Saṁyutta Nikāya 1:56

'What engenders a person?

What does one have that runs around?

What rushes toward the wandering-on?

From what is one not yet released?'

The Buddha:

'Craving           engenders a person.

One's mind           is what runs around.

A being           rushes toward the wandering-on.

From suffering           one's not yet released.'
