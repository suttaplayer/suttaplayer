SERVING DISHES
OKKHĀ SUTTA  Saṁyutta Nikāya 20:4

Staying near Sāvatthī. 'Monks, if someone were to give a gift of one hundred serving dishes (of food) in the morning, one hundred at mid-day, and one hundred in the evening; and another person were to develop a mind of good-will—even for the time it takes to pull on a cow's udder—in the morning, again at mid-day, and again in the evening, this [the second action] would be more fruitful than that (the first).

'Thus you should train yourselves: 'Our awareness-release through good-will will be cultivated, developed, pursued, given a means of transport, given a grounding, steadied, consolidated, & well-undertaken. That's how you should train yourselves.'
