FACULTIES
INDRIYA SUTTA  Saṁyutta Nikāya 35:153

Then a certain monk went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One, 'Consummate in faculties, consummate in faculties,' it is said. To what extent is one consummate in faculties?'

'If a monk, while keeping track of arising & passing away with regard to the eye-faculty, becomes disenchanted with the eye-faculty; if, while keeping track of arising & passing away with regard to the ear-faculty… the nose-faculty… the tongue-faculty… the body faculty… the intellect-faculty, he becomes disenchanted with the intellect-faculty; and, disenchanted, he becomes dispassionate; through dispassion, he is released; with release, there is the knowledge, 'Released'; he discerns that 'Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for this world,' it is to this extent that one is consummate in faculties.'
