SHAME
HIRI SUTTA  Saṁyutta Nikāya 1:18

'Who in the world

is a man constrained by shame,

who awakens to censure

like a fine stallion     to the whip?'

'Those restrained by shame

are rare—

those who go through life

always mindful.

Having reached the end

of suffering & stress,

they go among the discordant

harmoniously.'
