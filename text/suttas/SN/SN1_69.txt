DESIRE
ICCHĀ SUTTA  Saṁyutta Nikāya 1:69

'With what         is the world tied down?

With the subduing

of what         is it freed?

With the abandoning

of what

are all bonds

cut through?'

The Buddha:

'With desire         the world is tied down.

With the subduing

of desire         it's freed.

With the abandoning

of desire

all bonds

are cut through.'
