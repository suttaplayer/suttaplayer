COMPREHENSION
PARIÑÑA SUTTA  Saṁyutta Nikāya 22:23

Near Sāvatthī. 'Monks, I will teach you the phenomena to be comprehended, as well as comprehension. Listen & pay close attention. I will speak.'

'As you say, lord,' the monks responded to him.

The Blessed One said, 'And which are the phenomena to be comprehended? Form is a phenomenon to be comprehended. Feeling… Perception… Fabrications… Consciousness is a phenomenon to be comprehended. These are called phenomena to be comprehended.

'And which is comprehension? Any ending of passion, ending of aversion, ending of delusion: This is called comprehension.'
