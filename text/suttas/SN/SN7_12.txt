UDAYA
UDAYA SUTTA  Saṁyutta Nikāya 7:12

Near Sāvatthī. Then early in the morning, the Blessed One, having adjusted his under robe and carrying his bowl & outer robe, went to the home of the brahman Udaya. The brahman Udaya filled the Blessed One's bowl with rice.

Then a second time, [on the next day,] the Blessed One, having adjusted his under robe and carrying his bowl & outer robe, went to the home of the brahman Udaya. And a second time, the brahman Udaya filled the Blessed One's bowl with rice.

Then a third time, [on the following day,] the Blessed One, having adjusted his under robe and carrying his bowl & outer robe, went to the home of the brahman Udaya. And a third time, the brahman Udaya, having filled the Blessed One's bowl with rice, said to him, 'This pesky Gotama contemplative keeps coming again & again.'

The Buddha:

'Again & again      they sow the seed.

Again & again      the deva-kings rain.

Again & again      farmers plow the fields.

Again & again      grain comes to the kingdom.

Again & again      beggars wander.

Again & again      lords of giving give.

Again & again      having given, the lords of giving

again & again      go to a heavenly place.

Again & again      dairy farmers draw milk.

Again & again      the calf goes to its mother.

Again & again      one wearies & trembles.

Again & again      the dullard goes to the womb.

Again & again      you take birth & die.

Again & again      they carry you to the charnel ground.

But on gaining the path

to no again-becoming,

you, deep in discernment,

don't take birth

again & again.'

When this was said, the brahman Udaya said to the Blessed One, 'Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent! Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned, to reveal what was hidden, to show the way to one who was lost, or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms, in the same way has Master Gotama—through many lines of reasoning—made the Dhamma clear. I go to Master Gotama for refuge, to the Dhamma, & to the Saṅgha of monks. May Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge from this day forward, for life.'
