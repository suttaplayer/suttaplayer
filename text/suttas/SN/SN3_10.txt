BONDS
BANDHANA SUTTA  Saṁyutta Nikāya 3:10

At Sāvatthī. Now on that occasion a great group of people had been put into bondage by King Pasenadi Kosala—some with ropes, some with wooden shackles, some with chains.

Then in the early morning, a large number of monks adjusted their under robes and—carrying their bowls & outer robes—went into Sāvatthī for alms. Having gone for alms in Sāvatthī, after the meal, returning from their alms round, they went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As they were sitting there, they said to the Blessed One, 'Lord, a great group of people has now been put into bondage by King Pasenadi Kosala—some with ropes, some with wooden shackles, some with chains.'

Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion spoke these verses:

That's not a strong bond

—so say the enlightened—

the one made of iron, of wood, or of grass.

To be smitten, enthralled,

with jewels & ornaments,

longing for children & wives:

That's the strong bond,

—so say the enlightened—

one that's constraining,

elastic,

hard to untie.

But having cut it, they

—the enlightened—go forth,

free of longing, abandoning

sensual ease.
