KASSAPA THE DEVA'S SON
KASSAPA SUTTA  Saṁyutta Nikāya 2:2

Near Sāvatthi in the monastery… Standing to one side, Kassapa the deva's son recited this verse in the Blessed One's presence:

'A monk should have jhāna,

be released in mind,

if he wants the heart's attainment:

knowing the arising & passing away of the world,

good in his awareness, independent,

aimed at that reward.'
