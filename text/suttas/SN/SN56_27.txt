REAL
TATHA SUTTA  Saṁyutta Nikāya 56:27

'Monks, there are these four noble truths. Which four? The noble truth of stress, the noble truth of the origination of stress, the noble truth of the cessation of stress, & the noble truth of the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress.

'These four noble truths are real, not unreal, with no alteration. That is why they are called 'noble truths.'

'Therefore, monks, your duty is the contemplation, 'This is stress … This is the origination of stress … This is the cessation of stress.' Your duty is the contemplation, 'This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress.'
