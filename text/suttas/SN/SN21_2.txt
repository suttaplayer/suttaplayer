ABOUT UPATISSA (SĀRIPUTTA)
UPATISSA SUTTA  Saṁyutta Nikāya 21:2

Near Sāvatthī. There Venerable Sāriputta addressed the monks: 'Friends!'

'Yes, friend,' the monks responded.

Venerable Sāriputta said, 'Friends, just now as I was withdrawn in seclusion, this train of thought arose to my awareness: 'Is there anything in the world with whose change or alteration there would arise within me sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, & despair?' Then the thought occurred to me: 'There is nothing in the world with whose change or alteration there would arise within me sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, & despair.'

When this was said, Venerable Ānanda said to Venerable Sāriputta, 'Sāriputta my friend, even if there were change & alteration in the Teacher would there arise within you no sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, or despair?'

'Even if there were change & alteration in the Teacher, my friend, there would arise within me no sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, or despair. Still, I would have this thought: 'What a great being, of great might, of great prowess, has disappeared! For if the Blessed One were to remain for a long time, that would be for the benefit of many people, for the happiness of many people, out of sympathy for the world; for the welfare, benefit, & happiness of human & divine beings.'

'Surely,' (said Venerable Ānanda,) 'it's because Venerable Sāriputta's I-making & mine-making and obsession with conceit have long been well uprooted that even if there were change & alteration in the Teacher, there would arise within him no sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, or despair.'
