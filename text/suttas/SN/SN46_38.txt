HINDRANCES
NĪVARAṆA SUTTA  Saṁyutta Nikāya 46:38

'Monks, whenever a disciple of the noble ones listens to the Dhamma—receptive, attentive, focusing his entire awareness, lending ear—on that occasion his five hindrances don't exist, and seven factors for awakening go to the completion of their development.

'And which of his five hindrances don't exist on that occasion? The hindrance of sensual desire doesn't exist on that occasion. The hindrance of ill will… The hindrance of sloth & drowsiness… The hindrance of restlessness & anxiety… The hindrance of uncertainty doesn't exist on that occasion.

'His five hindrances don't exist on that occasion.

'And which seven factors for awakening go to the completion of their development on that occasion? Mindfulness as a factor for awakening goes to the completion of its development on that occasion. Analysis of qualities as a factor for awakening… Persistence as a factor for awakening… Rapture as a factor for awakening… Calm as a factor for awakening… Concentration as a factor for awakening… Equanimity as a factor for awakening goes to the completion of its development on that occasion. These are the seven factors for awakening that go to the completion of their development on that occasion.
