ONE QUALITY
EKADHAMMA SUTTA  Saṁyutta Nikāya 46:29

'Monks, I don't envision any one other quality that, when thus developed & pursued, leads to the abandoning of things conducive to the fetters, aside from the seven factors for awakening. Which seven?

'There is the case where a monk develops mindfulness as a factor for awakening dependent on seclusion, dependent on dispassion, dependent on cessation, resulting in letting go. He develops analysis of qualities as a factor for awakening… persistence as a factor for awakening… rapture as a factor for awakening… calm as a factor for awakening… concentration as a factor for awakening… equanimity as a factor for awakening dependent on seclusion, dependent on dispassion, dependent on cessation, resulting in letting go.

'When thus developed & pursued, the seven factors for awakening lead to the abandoning of things conducive to the fetters.

'And what are the things conducive to the fetters? The eye is a thing conducive to the fetters. It is here that these fetters, shackles, & graspings arise.

'The ear… the nose… the tongue… the body… the intellect is a thing conducive to the fetters. It is here that these fetters, shackles, & graspings arise. These are called the things conducive to the fetters.'
