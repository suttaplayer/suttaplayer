ĀNANDA (INSTRUCTIONS TO VAṄGĪSA)
ĀNANDA SUTTA  Saṁyutta Nikāya 8:4

On one occasion Venerable Ānanda was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery. Then early in the morning, having adjusted his lower robe and taking his bowl & outer robe, he went into Sāvatthī for alms with Venerable Vaṅgīsa as his attendant monk. Now at that time dissatisfaction (with the celibate life) had arisen in Venerable Vaṅgīsa. Lust invaded his mind. So he addressed Venerable Ānanda with this verse:

'With sensual lust            I burn.

My mind            is on fire.

Please, Gotama,            from compassion,

tell me how

to put it out.'

Venerable Ānanda:

'From distorted perception

your mind is on fire.

Shun the theme            of the beautiful

accompanied by lust.

See mental fabrications      as other,

as stress,

& not-self.

Extinguish your great lust.

Don't keep burning again & again.

Develop the mind

—well-centered & one—

in the foul,

through the foul.

Have your mindfulness

immersed in the body.

Be one who pursues

disenchantment.

Develop the theme-less.

Cast out conceit.

Then, from breaking through

conceit,

you will go on your way,

at peace.'
