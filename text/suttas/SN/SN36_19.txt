PAÑCAKAṄGA
PAÑCAKAṄGA SUTTA  Saṁyutta Nikāya 36:19

Then Pañcakaṅga the carpenter went to Venerable Udāyin and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there, he said to Venerable Udāyin, 'Venerable Udāyin, how many feelings have been described by the Blessed One?'

'The Blessed One has described three feelings, householder: a feeling of pleasure, a feeling of pain, a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain. These are the three feelings described by the Blessed One.'

When this was said, Pañcakaṅga the carpenter said to Venerable Udāyin, 'No, Venerable Udāyin, the Blessed One hasn't described three feelings, he's described two feelings: a feeling of pleasure & a feeling of pain. As for the feeling of neither pleasure nor pain, that has been described by the Blessed One as a peaceful, sublime pleasure.'

A second time… A third time, Venerable Udāyin said to Pañcakaṅga the carpenter, 'No, householder, the Blessed One hasn't described two feelings, he's described three feelings: a feeling of pleasure, a feeling of pain, a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain. These are the three feelings described by the Blessed One.'

A second time… A third time, Pañcakaṅga the carpenter said to Venerable Udāyin, 'No, Venerable Udāyin, the Blessed One hasn't described three feelings, he's described two feelings: a feeling of pleasure & a feeling of pain. As for the feeling of neither pleasure nor pain, that has been described by the Blessed One as a peaceful, sublime pleasure.'

But neither was Venerable Udāyin able to convince Pañcakaṅga the carpenter, nor was Pañcakaṅga the carpenter able to convince Venerable Udāyin.

Venerable Ānanda heard of Venerable Udāyin's conversation with Pañcakaṅga the carpenter. So he went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there, he told the Blessed One the entire extent of Venerable Udāyin's conversation with Pañcakaṅga the carpenter.

(The Blessed One said,) 'Ānanda, it was a genuine exposition that Pañcakaṅga the carpenter didn't accept from Udāyin the monk, and it was a genuine exposition that Udāyin the monk didn't accept from Pañcakaṅga the carpenter. There is the exposition whereby I have spoken of two feelings, the exposition whereby I have spoken of three feelings… five… six… eighteen… thirty-six… one hundred and eight feelings.

'Thus I have taught the Dhamma by means of exposition. When I have taught the Dhamma by means of exposition, if there are those who do not concede, allow, or approve of what has been well-spoken & well-stated by one another, it can be expected that they will dwell arguing, quarreling, & disputing, stabbing one another with weapons of the mouth.

Thus I have taught the Dhamma by means of exposition. When I have taught the Dhamma by means of exposition, if there are those who concede, allow, & approve of what has been well-spoken & well-stated by one another, it can be expected that they will dwell harmoniously, cordially, without dispute, becoming like milk mixed with water, regarding one another with affectionate eyes.

'Ānanda, there are these five strings of sensuality. Which five? Forms cognizable via the eye—agreeable, pleasing, charming, endearing, enticing, linked with sensual desire. Sounds cognizable via the ear… Aromas cognizable via the nose… Flavors cognizable via the tongue… Tactile sensations cognizable via the body—agreeable, pleasing, charming, endearing, enticing, linked with sensual desire. Now, whatever pleasure & joy arises in dependence on these five strings of sensuality, that is called sensual pleasure.

'Though there are those who say, 'They [i e, beings] experience this as the highest existing pleasure & joy,' I do not grant them that. Why is that? Because there is another pleasure more excellent than that pleasure and more sublime.

'And which, Ānanda, is the other pleasure more excellent than that pleasure and more sublime? There is the case where a monk—quite secluded from sensuality, secluded from unskillful qualities—enters & remains in the first jhāna: rapture & pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by directed thought & evaluation. This is the other pleasure more excellent than that pleasure and more sublime.

'Though there are those who say, 'They experience this as the highest existing pleasure & joy,' I do not grant them that. Why is that? Because there is another pleasure more excellent than that pleasure and more sublime.

'And which, Ānanda, is the other pleasure more excellent than that pleasure and more sublime? There is the case where, with the stilling of directed thoughts & evaluations, a monk enters & remains in the second jhāna: rapture & pleasure born of concentration, unification of awareness free from directed thought & evaluation—internal assurance. This is the other pleasure more excellent than that pleasure and more sublime.

'Though there are those who say, 'They experience this as the highest existing pleasure & joy,' I do not grant them that. Why is that? Because there is another pleasure more excellent than that pleasure and more sublime.

'And which, Ānanda, is the other pleasure more excellent than that pleasure and more sublime? There is the case where a monk, with the fading of rapture, remains equanimous, mindful, & alert, and senses pleasure with the body. He enters & remains in the third jhāna, of which the noble ones declare, 'Equanimous & mindful, he has a pleasant abiding.' This is the other pleasure more excellent than that pleasure and more sublime.

'Though there are those who say, 'They experience this as the highest existing pleasure & joy,' I do not grant them that. Why is that? Because there is another pleasure more excellent than that pleasure and more sublime.

'And which, Ānanda, is the other pleasure more excellent than that pleasure and more sublime? There is the case where a monk, with the abandoning of pleasure & pain—as with the earlier disappearance of elation & distress—enters & remains in the fourth jhāna: purity of equanimity & mindfulness, neither pleasure nor pain. This is the other pleasure more excellent than that pleasure and more sublime.

'Though there are those who say, 'They experience this as the highest existing pleasure & joy,' I do not grant them that. Why is that? Because there is another pleasure more excellent than that pleasure and more sublime.

'And which, Ānanda, is the other pleasure more excellent than that pleasure and more sublime? There is the case where a monk, with the complete transcending of perceptions of form, with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance, and not attending to perceptions of multiplicity, (perceiving,) 'Infinite space,' enters & remains in the dimension of the infinitude of space. This is the other pleasure more excellent than that pleasure and more sublime.

'Though there are those who say, 'They experience this as the highest existing pleasure & joy,' I do not grant them that. Why is that? Because there is another pleasure more excellent than that pleasure and more sublime.

'And which, Ānanda, is the other pleasure more excellent than that pleasure and more sublime? There is the case where a monk, with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of space, (perceiving,) 'Infinite consciousness,' enters & remains in the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness. This is the other pleasure more excellent than that pleasure and more sublime.

'Though there are those who say, 'They experience this as the highest existing pleasure & joy,' I do not grant them that. Why is that? Because there is another pleasure more excellent than that pleasure and more sublime.

'And which, Ānanda, is the other pleasure more excellent than that pleasure and more sublime? There is the case where a monk, with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness, (perceiving,) 'There is nothing,' enters & remains in the dimension of nothingness. This is the other pleasure more excellent than that pleasure and more sublime.

'Though there are those who say, 'They experience this as the highest existing pleasure & joy,' I do not grant them that. Why is that? Because there is another pleasure more excellent than that pleasure and more sublime.

'And which, Ānanda, is the other pleasure more excellent than that pleasure and more sublime? There is the case where a monk, with the complete transcending of the dimension of nothingness, enters & remains in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. This is the other pleasure more excellent than that pleasure and more sublime.

'Though there are those who say, 'They experience this as the highest existing pleasure & joy,' I do not grant them that. Why is that? Because there is another pleasure more excellent than that pleasure and more sublime.

'And which, Ānanda, is the other pleasure more excellent than that pleasure and more sublime? There is the case where a monk, with the complete transcending of the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, enters & remains in the cessation of perception & feeling. This is the other pleasure more excellent than that pleasure and more sublime.

'Now, it's possible, Ānanda, that some wanderers of other persuasions might say, 'Gotama the contemplative speaks of the cessation of perception & feeling and yet describes it as pleasure. What is this? How is this?' When they say that, they are to be told, 'It's not the case, friends, that the Blessed One describes only pleasant feeling as included under pleasure. Wherever pleasure is found, in whatever terms, the Blessed One describes it as pleasure.'
