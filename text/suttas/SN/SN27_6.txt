PERCEPTION
SAÑÑĀ SUTTA  Saṁyutta Nikāya 27:6

Near Sāvatthī. 'Monks, any desire-passion with regard to perception (naming, labeling) of forms is a defilement of the mind. Any desire-passion with regard to perception of sounds… perception of aromas… perception of flavors… perception of tactile sensations… perception of ideas is a defilement of the mind. When, with regard to these six bases, the defilements of awareness are abandoned, then the mind is inclined to renunciation. The mind fostered by renunciation feels malleable for the direct knowing of those qualities worth realizing.'
