FOND OF CONCEIT
MANAKĀMA SUTTA  Saṁyutta Nikāya 1:9

Standing to one side, a devatā addressed the Blessed One with a verse:

'Here there's no taming

for one fond of conceit,

no sagacity

for one unconcentrated.

One dwelling alone in the wilderness

heedlessly

won't cross over beyond

Deaths' realm.

The Buddha:

'Abandoning conceit,

his mind well-concentrated,

well-aware, everywhere

released,

one dwelling alone in the wilderness

heedfully:

He will cross over beyond

Death's realm.
