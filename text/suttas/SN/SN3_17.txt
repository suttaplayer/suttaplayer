HEEDFULNESS
APPAMĀDA SUTTA  Saṁyutta Nikāya 3:17

Near Sāvatthī. As he was sitting to one side, King Pasenadi Kosala said to the Blessed One: 'Is there, lord, any one quality that keeps both kinds of benefits secure—benefits in this life & benefits in lives to come?'

'There is one quality, great king, that keeps both kinds of benefits secure— benefits in this life & benefits in lives to come.'

'But what, lord, is that one quality… ?'

'Heedfulness, great king. Just as the footprints of all living beings with legs can be encompassed by the footprint of the elephant, and the elephant's footprint is declared to be supreme among them in terms of its great size; in the same way, heedfulness is the one quality that keeps both kinds of benefits secure—benefits in this life & benefits in lives to come.'

That is what the Blessed One said. Having said that, the One Well-Gone, the Teacher, said further:

'For one who desires

long life, health,

beauty, heaven, & noble birth,

—lavish delights, one after another—

the wise praise heedfulness

in doing acts of merit.

When heedful, wise,

you achieve both kinds of benefit:

benefits         in this life,

& benefits         in lives to come.

By breaking through to your benefit,

you're called enlightened,

wise.
