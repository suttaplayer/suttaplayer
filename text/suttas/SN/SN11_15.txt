A DELIGHTFUL PLACE
RĀMAṆEYYAKA SUTTA  Saṁyutta Nikāya 11:15

On one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery. Then Sakka the deva-king went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, stood to one side. As he was standing there, he said to the Blessed One, 'What, lord, is a delightful place?'

The Buddha:

'Park shrines, forest shrines,

well-constructed lotus ponds

aren't worth one-sixteenth

of a delightful human being.

In village or wilds,

valley, plateau:

that place is delightful

where arahants dwell.'
