THE WORLD
LOKA SUTTA  Saṁyutta Nikāya 35:82

Then a certain monk went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there, he said to the Blessed One: 'The world, the world [loka],' it is said. In what respect does the word 'world' apply?'

'Insofar as it disintegrates [lujjati], monk, it is called the 'world.' Now what disintegrates? The eye disintegrates. Forms disintegrate. Eye-consciousness disintegrates. Eye-contact disintegrates. And whatever there is that arises in dependence on eye-contact—experienced as pleasure, pain or neither-pleasure-nor-pain—that too disintegrates.

'The ear disintegrates. Sounds disintegrate…

'The nose disintegrates. Aromas disintegrate…

'The tongue disintegrates. Tastes disintegrate…

'The body disintegrates. Tactile sensations disintegrate…

'The intellect disintegrates. Ideas disintegrate. Intellect-consciousness disintegrates. Intellect-contact disintegrates. And whatever there is that arises in dependence on intellect-contact—experienced as pleasure, pain or neither-pleasure-nor-pain—that too disintegrates.

'Insofar as it disintegrates, it is called the 'world.'

[Because the word loka can also mean 'cosmos,' this discourse can also be translated as follows:]

Then a certain monk went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there, he said to the Blessed One: 'The cosmos, the cosmos [loka],' it is said. In what respect does the word 'cosmos' apply?'

'Insofar as it disintegrates [lujjati], monk, it is called the 'cosmos.' Now what disintegrates? The eye disintegrates. Forms disintegrate. Eye-consciousness disintegrates. Eye-contact disintegrates. And whatever there is that arises in dependence on eye-contact—experienced as pleasure, pain or neither-pleasure-nor-pain—that too disintegrates.
