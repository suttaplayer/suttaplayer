(QUALITIES OF) THE WORLD
LOKA SUTTA  Saṁyutta Nikāya 3:23

Near Sāvatthī. As he was sitting to one side, King Pasenadi Kosala said to the Blessed One: 'How many qualities of the world that, when arising, arise for harm, stress, & discomfort?'

'Three qualities of the world, great king, when arising, arise for harm, stress, & discomfort. Which three? Greed, great king, is a quality of the world that, when arising, arises for harm, stress, & discomfort. Aversion… Delusion is a quality of the world that, when arising, arises for harm, stress, & discomfort. These are the three qualities of the world, great king, that when arising, arise for harm, stress, & discomfort.'

That is what the Blessed One said. Having said that, the One Well-Gone, the Teacher, said further:

'Greed, aversion, & delusion

—born from oneself—

destroy

the person of evil awareness,

as its own fruit, the reed.'
