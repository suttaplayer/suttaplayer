HAVING KILLED
CHETVĀ SUTTA  Saṁyutta Nikāya 1:71

As she was standing to one side, a devatā recited this verse to the Blessed One:

'Having killed what

do you sleep in ease?

Having killed what

do you not grieve?

Of the slaying

of what one thing

does Gotama approve?'

The Buddha:

'Having killed anger

you sleep in ease.

Having killed anger

you do not grieve.

The noble ones praise

the slaying of anger

—with its honeyed crest

& poison root—

for having killed it

you do not grieve.'
