PHASSA SUTTA  Saṁyutta Nikāya 27:4

Near Sāvatthī. 'Monks, any desire-passion with regard to contact at the eye is a defilement of the mind. Any desire-passion with regard to contact at the ear… contact at the nose… contact at the tongue… contact at the body… contact at the intellect is a defilement of the mind. When, with regard to these six bases, the defilements of awareness are abandoned, then the mind is inclined to renunciation. The mind fostered by renunciation feels malleable for the direct knowing of those qualities worth realizing.'
