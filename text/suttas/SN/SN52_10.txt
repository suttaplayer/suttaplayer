ILLNESS
GILĀYANA SUTTA  Saṁyutta Nikāya 52:10

I have heard that on one occasion Venerable Anuruddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the Dark Forest—diseased, in pain, severely ill. Then a large number of monks went to Venerable Anuruddha and on arrival said to him, 'What (mental) dwelling are you dwelling in so that the pains that have arisen in the body do not invade or remain in the mind?'

'When I dwell with my mind well-established in the four establishings of mindfulness, the pains that have arisen in the body do not invade or remain in the mind. Which four? There is the case where I remain focused on the body in & of itself—ardent, alert, & mindful—subduing greed & distress with reference to the world. I remain focused on feelings in & of themselves… mind in & of itself… mental qualities in & of themselves—ardent, alert, & mindful—subduing greed & distress with reference to the world. When I dwell with my mind well-established in these four establishings of mindfulness, the pains that have arisen in the body do not invade or remain in the mind.'
