THE HIMALAYAS (ON THE FACTORS FOR AWAKENING)
HIMAVANTA SUTTA  Saṁyutta Nikāya 46:1

'Monks, it is in dependence on the Himalayas, the king of mountains, that serpents [nāgas] grow in body and gain in strength. Having grown in body and gained strength there, they descend to the small lakes. Having descended to the small lakes, they descend to the large lakes… the small rivers… the large rivers… to the great ocean. There they attain greatness & prosperity in terms of the body.

'In the same way, it is in dependence on virtue, established on virtue, having developed & pursued the seven factors for awakening, that a monk attains to greatness & prosperity in terms of mental qualities. And how is it that a monk—in dependence on virtue, established on virtue, having developed & pursued the seven factors for awakening—attains to greatness & prosperity in terms of mental qualities?

'There is the case where a monk develops mindfulness as a factor for awakening dependent on seclusion, dependent on dispassion, dependent on cessation, resulting in relinquishment. He develops analysis of qualities as a factor for awakening… persistence as a factor for awakening… rapture as a factor for awakening… calm as a factor for awakening… concentration as a factor for awakening… equanimity as a factor for awakening dependent on seclusion, dependent on dispassion, dependent on cessation, resulting in relinquishment. This is how a monk—in dependence on virtue, established on virtue, having developed & pursued the seven factors for awakening—attains to greatness & prosperity in terms of mental qualities.'
