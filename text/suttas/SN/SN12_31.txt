On one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery. There he addressed Venerable Sāriputta, 'Sāriputta, it is said in Ajita's Question in the Way to the Further Shore :

'Those here who have fathomed the Dhamma,

those who are learners,

those who are run-of-the-mill:

When you, dear sir, astute,

are asked this,

tell me their manner of life.'

How is the detailed meaning of this brief statement to be understood?'

When this was said, Venerable Sāriputta remained silent.

A second time .… A third time the Blessed One addressed Venerable Sāriputta, 'Sāriputta, it is said in Ajita's Question in the Way to the Further Shore:

'Those here who have fathomed the Dhamma,

those who are learners,

those who are run-of-the-mill:

How is the detailed meaning of this brief statement to be understood?'

A third time, Venerable Sāriputta remained silent.

'Do you see, Sāriputta, that 'this has come into being'?'

One sees with right discernment that 'it has come into being from this nutriment.' Seeing with right discernment as it has come to be that 'it has come into being from this nutriment,' one practices for disenchantment with, for dispassion toward, for the cessation of the nutriment by which it has come into being. One sees with right discernment as it has come to be that 'from the cessation of this nutriment, what has come into being is subject to cessation.' Seeing with right discernment as it has come to be that 'from the cessation of this nutriment, what has come into being is subject to cessation,' one practices for disenchantment with, for dispassion toward, for the cessation of what is subject to cessation. This is how one is a learner.

'And how, lord, is one a person who has fathomed the Dhamma?
