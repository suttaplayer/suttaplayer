GAVAMPATI
GAVAMPATI SUTTA  Saṁyutta Nikāya 56:30

On one occasion a larger number of elder monks were staying among the Cetiyas at Sahajani [Sahajati]. And on that occasion a large number of elder monks, after the meal, on returning from their alms round, were sitting gathered together in a pavilion when this discussion arose: 'Is it the case that whoever sees stress also sees the origination of stress, the cessation of stress, & the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress?'

When this was said, Venerable Gavampati the Elder said, 'Face to face with the Blessed One did I hear this, friends, face to face did I receive it: 'Monks, whoever sees stress also sees the origination of stress, the cessation of stress, & the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress.

'Whoever sees the origination of stress also sees stress, the cessation of stress, & the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress.

'Whoever sees the cessation of stress also sees stress, the origination of stress, & the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress.

'Whoever sees the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress also sees stress, the origination of stress, & the cessation of stress.'
