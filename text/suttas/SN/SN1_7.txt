UNPENETRATED
APPAṬIVIDITĀ SUTTA  Saṁyutta Nikāya 1:7

Standing to one side, a devatā addressed the Blessed One with a verse:

'Those in whom

phenomena are unpenetrated,

who may be led

by the teachings of others:

Asleep are they;

they haven't awakened.

It's time for them

to awaken.'

The Buddha:

'Those in whom

phenomena are well-penetrated,

may not be led

by the teachings of others.

Awakened

through right knowing,

they go among the discordant

harmoniously.'
