AN ARAHANT
ARAHANTA SUTTA  Saṁyutta Nikāya 1:25

'An arahant monk,

one who is done,

effluent-free, bearing his last body:

Would he say, 'I speak'?

Would he say, 'They speak to me'?'

'An arahant monk,

one who is done,

effluent-free, bearing his last body:

He would say, 'I speak';

would say, 'They speak to me.'

Skillful,

knowing harmonious gnosis

with regard to the world,

he uses expressions

just as expressions.'

'An arahant monk,

one who is done,

effluent-free, bearing his last body:

Is it from conceit

that he'd say, ' I speak'?—

that he'd say, 'They speak to me'?'

'For one whose conceit is abandoned,

whose knot of conceit is dispersed,

no knots exist

at all.

He, beyond any concept, wise,

would say, 'I speak';

would say, 'They speak to me.'

Skillful,

knowing harmonious gnosis

with regard to the world,

he uses expressions

just as expressions.'
