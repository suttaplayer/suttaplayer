SISTER GOTAMĪ
GOTAMĪ SUTTA  Saṁyutta Nikāya 5:3

Near Sāvatthī. Then, early in the morning, Kisā Gotamī the nun adjusted her robes and, taking her bowl & outer robe, went into Sāvatthī for alms. When she had gone for alms in Sāvatthī and had returned from her alms round, after her meal she went to the Grove of the Blind to spend the day. Having gone deep into the Grove of the Blind, she sat down at the foot of a tree for the day's abiding.

Then Māra the Evil One, wanting to arouse fear, horripilation, & terror in her, wanting to make her fall away from concentration, approached her & addressed her in verse:

'Why,

with your sons killed,

do you sit all alone,

your face in tears?

All alone,

immersed in the midst of the forest,

are you looking

for a man?'

Then the thought occurred to Kisā Gotamī the nun: 'Now who has recited this verse—a human being or a non-human one?' Then it occurred to her: 'This is Māra the Evil One who has recited this verse wanting to arouse fear, horripilation, & terror in me, wanting to make me fall away from concentration.'

Then, having understood that 'This is Māra the Evil One,' she replied to him in verses:

'I've gotten past

the killing of sons,

have made that the end

to (my search for) men.

I don't grieve,

I don't weep—

and I'm not afraid of you,

my friend.

It's everywhere destroyed—delight.

The mass of darkness is shattered.

Having defeated the army of death,

free

of effluents

I dwell.'

Then Māra the Evil One—sad & dejected at realizing, 'Kisā Gotamī the nun knows me'—vanished right there.
